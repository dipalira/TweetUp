"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

recreational support group for mental well-being.,"<p>Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness.

This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"
A Confidential Therapy Group for Women!,"<p>Welcome! This wonderful, confidential therapy group is facilitated by local clinical psychologist Carla Marie Manly, Ph.D. The group focuses on a variety of important issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and isolation. The group provides support and encouragement during life transitions such as divorce, relationship changes, and career changes. We work on setting and achieving personal goals within a positive, meaningful framework. The group provides a safe place for women of all ages to build their confidence, receive feedback, and find inner strength by sharing with other women in a safe and peaceful environment. This group also offers skill-building and strategies to help women cope with life stresses and challenges. This group is limited to 7 members and is ongoing on a weekly basis. The fee is $25.00 per session.</p>
<p>At the start of each group, each member has an opportunity to check in and discuss current challenges and concerns in a supportive and encouraging environment. We address a wide variety of important topics such as anxiety, depression, isolation, relationship concerns, and low self-esteem. Compassionate, therapeutic insights are offered to promote healing, self-awareness, and positive changes. We focus on understanding and utilizing practical strategies to improve self-confidence, coping skills, and interpersonal relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>As we move through various topics, you'll find that your inner awareness and strength grows. You will come away from each session with a better understanding of yourself and how you interact with others. You'll find encouragement in meeting with other women whose life experiences illuminate your own struggles. A sense of vital interconnection develops as you realize that your own insights and experiences also benefit others! The group discussions change as we move forward, and the themes will evolve naturally as life circumstances change.<em><strong>The ultimate goal is to help each woman create the joy-filled, passionate life of her dreams!</strong></em></p>

<p>DBSA Palo Alto is a peer-run support group. We provide hope, help, support and education to help improve the lives of people who have mood disorders.

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>
<p>Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.</p>
<p>You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.<span><br></span></p>

Now, I am so grateful that I have fully overcome this challenge and now living with power and peace of mind. To give back, I have created this talk group to help you go from being overwhelmingly anxious to having clarify, freedom and peace of mind in your daily dealings of life.

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

<p><br>Anxiety and Depression aren't just in our heads; they live in our bodies as well. The practice of yoga can help us use our bodies to change the way our minds respond to anxiety and depression. This workshop is designed to give yoga teachers and practitioners an understanding of this process, provide an introductory understanding of how to assess your mind/body state, and provide yogic tools for your personal practice of mind/body healing and management. These concepts will be particularly useful for anyone using yoga as part of their therapy to help heal and live with mental health issues.</p> 
<p><br>In this class, we will explore:</p> 
<p>How yogic ideas and principles relate to the science of mental health and wellness.</p> 
<p>How we can use the practice of yoga to address mental distress and create safety in the body and mind.</p> 
<p>Getting on the mat and working with the poses.</p> 
<p>This workshop will include movement, breathwork, lecture, and conversation. All levels are welcome! The structure of the day is as follows:</p> 
<p>1). A shorter. all-levels yoga practice</p> 
<p> 2) Exploration of current psychological research on how the body can affect the mind (and vice versa)</p> 
<p>3) Examination of the nervous system and its role in depression and anxiety</p> 
<p>4) A 45 minute lunch break</p> 
<p>5) Learning postures, movements, and breath that address anxiety and depression respectively 6) Embodied practice of these techniques</p> 
<p>7) An introduction to assessing your mind/body needs, and how to choose what tools to address them. Cost is $79 Early Bird and $99 after June 2nd. A portion of the proceeds go to support the Against the Stream Mediation Center (www.againstthestream.com).</p> 
<p><br>Candace has studied with Bessel van der Kolk and Bo Forbes, as well as her primary teacher, Shiva Rae, and this work is deeply inspired by them.

Petaluma Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for those suffering, or know someone who is suffering, from anxiety, depression, or PTSD. This group is intended to offer a sense of community and solidarity for those who might feel they are alone in their struggles. Meetings will consist of sharing experiences with anxiety, depression, and PTSD; and activities that we might use to help get us through our bouts of anxiety, breathing exercises, and meditative practices. This is not a therapy group. There will be no licensed professionals, so there will be no cross-talk, cross analyses, or advice given about personal issues. The intention is to create a safe space for people suffering from anxiety, depression, or PTSD, either directly or indirectly, to express, find an outlet, and acquire a circle of support as they continue their own journey in overcoming their struggles.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety and Depression', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-and-depression', u'id': 1509480}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"
recreational support group for mental well-being.,"<p>Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness. We ourselves are the most intuitive of our body, thoughts, and emotions. Together, by sharing fun, love, and understanding from the community, we can empower ourselves and learn to see our unique sensitivities as strengths.</p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Yoga', u'urlkey': u'yoga', u'id': 244}, {u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Meditation', u'urlkey': u'meditation', u'id': 1322}, {u'name': u'Art', u'urlkey': u'art', u'id': 1502}, {u'name': u'Psychiatric Disorders', u'urlkey': u'mentalill', u'id': 6619}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Artists', u'urlkey': u'boston-artists', u'id': 16573}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}]"

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"

Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,"<p>Ages 18+</p>
<p>This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.</p>
<p>I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge &amp; information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on. ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Step/dp/1497584566"">Overcoming Social Anxiety: Step by Step</a>"" is a great book and manual on how to remove anxiety. There's also an&nbsp;<a href=""https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety"">audio-series</a> of the book with some extra features. I'm not affiliated with this program and book.</p>

Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group. <br></p>

Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,"<p>This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.</p>
<p>The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.</p>
<p>We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.</p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Alternative Medicine', u'urlkey': u'alternative-medicine', u'id': 17150}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}]"
San Jose Anxiety & Depression Social Support Group,"<p><span>We typically get together on Sunday afternoon about twice a month and chat at a park in San Jose and possible future events in the Fremont area as well. This is an informal group not facilitated by a Licensed mental health professional, just peer run. If this sounds like a meetup you would like to attend, please join.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>
<br>
<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,"<p>This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.</p>
<p>The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.</p>
<p>We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.</p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Alternative Medicine', u'urlkey': u'alternative-medicine', u'id': 17150}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}]"

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

In the beginning this group will focus mainly on support and collective brain-storming in order to assist anyone affected by mental health. As the group grows it is possible that a 12 step model similar to that used by AA could be implemented where ""sponsors"" (those who currently deal with or those who have dealt successfully with the challenges presented by their own mental health issues) are assigned to individuals to help guide them on their journey to a better life.</p>","[{u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Bipolar and Depression', u'urlkey': u'bipolar-and-depression', u'id': 60508}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}]"

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>

Petaluma Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for those suffering, or know someone who is suffering, from anxiety, depression, or PTSD. This group is intended to offer a sense of community and solidarity for those who might feel they are alone in their struggles. Meetings will consist of sharing experiences with anxiety, depression, and PTSD; and activities that we might use to help get us through our bouts of anxiety, breathing exercises, and meditative practices. This is not a therapy group. There will be no licensed professionals, so there will be no cross-talk, cross analyses, or advice given about personal issues. The intention is to create a safe space for people suffering from anxiety, depression, or PTSD, either directly or indirectly, to express, find an outlet, and acquire a circle of support as they continue their own journey in overcoming their struggles.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety and Depression', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-and-depression', u'id': 1509480}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>
<p>Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.</p>
<p>You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.<span><br></span></p>

Bay Area Not So Spontaneous Slackers,"<p>Do you ever want to do something, but you don't know what? Do you ever want to get out of the house, meet new people, start living your life, but you decide to think about it after the next episode of Pawn Stars is over? Do you sign up for meetup groups, vow to go to the next meetup, but by the time the meetup day comes you opt out because it's been 2 weeks and you don't feel like going anymore? If so, then you're a spontaneous slacker like me. We work best when we don't have too much time to think about what the meetup is going to be like. We are looking for meetup activities, any and all, within the week, or even a day or two. In short - the less time between your sign up and the meetup, the more likely you are to attend.

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>

<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

As the group grows it is possible that a 12 step model similar to that used by AA could be implemented where ""sponsors"" (those who currently deal with or those who have dealt successfully with the challenges presented by their own mental health issues) are assigned to individuals to help guide them on their journey to a better life.</p>","[{u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Bipolar and Depression', u'urlkey': u'bipolar-and-depression', u'id': 60508}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}]"

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>
<p>*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears. I am open to suggestions for meetups including joint meetups with groups that would be sensitive to socially anxious people.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'overcoming social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-social-anxiety', u'id': 89785}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}]"
Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>
<p>Steve has presented an initial idea for forming smaller support groups. &nbsp;The idea, and ongoing discussion about it can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Marin-Depression-Meetup/messages/boards/thread/50648925"">What's the plan?</a></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}, {u'name': u'Overcoming Depression', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-depression', u'id': 116438}, {u'name': u'Shyness', u'urlkey': u'shy', u'id': 414252}]"
Sober and Socially Awkward,"<p>How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?</p>
<p>For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human. &nbsp;I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. </p>
<p>I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.</p>
<p>I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.</p>
<p>By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.</p>
<p>For 5 years, I have done it alone. &nbsp;It fucking sucks.</p>
<p>The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. </p>
<p>I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication. &nbsp;This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.</p>

<p>Do you want to communicate freely?</p> 
<p>Do you want to have more self-confidence?</p>

<p>how to meet people, how to express yourself, how to start romantic relationships, etc. Even public speaking! We will have meetups and free classes on these topics, and we will connect with each other, learn about each other, and help each other improve in life.

The one place I've observed where people actually learned effective communication tools, and where people really improved self-confidence and changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, Church of Scientology.

East Bay INFJs For Friendship (20s-30s),"<p>East Bay INFJs For Friendship was founded to create relaxing and comfortable hang outs for INFJs from around the East Bay. Bonding over our NiFe traits and building quality friendships is our mission. Let's put in our warm efforts to make sure there will be plenty of support to go around.</p>
<p>Being an INFJ can be exhausting. There's a big brain and big heart in you, always fighting for control. You feel so much empathy and are so giving to others that sometimes, you need space to recharge and for folks to respect your personal bubble.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You want others to understand that, even though you may be soft-spoken, your usual banter is just the tip of the iceberg, and there's a whole world of creativity and thoughtfulness inside waiting to be discovered by the right person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You find yourself a humanitarian and a skeptic.</span></p>
<p><span>You are extremely idealistic with a tragic twist.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>You are very logical but deeply emotional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You want to be freely expressive of your feelings and your complex thoughts without being misunderstood or judged.</span></p>
<p><span>You feel like a walking contradiction all the time and yet everything makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<p><span>You're at a loss to explain your philosophies to most people so a lot of the time you just listen.</span></p>
<p><span>Your empathy allows you to easily tune in to how others are feeling.</span></p>
<p>You are introverted and keep to yourself but crave a genuine bond.</p>
<p>You finally sum up your spirit to go out and mingle, and then when you're actually outside you want to come back home.</p>
<p>If you can relate to any of the above traits of INFJs, this is the group for you. With your inclusion, let's create a fun-filled, positive social environment for everyone to bond.&nbsp;<span>Here we value respectful, kind friendships with our INFJs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you're an INFJ who can relate to this description, please join this group and help make it an active, event-filled community!</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'INFJ', u'urlkey': u'infj', u'id': 3381}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Myers-Briggs Type Indicator', u'urlkey': u'mbti', u'id': 9714}, {u'name': u'Personality Theory', u'urlkey': u'personality-theory', u'id': 14999}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Introversion', u'urlkey': u'introversion', u'id': 21340}, {u'name': u'Introverted', u'urlkey': u'introverted', u'id': 21341}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Highly Sensitive People', u'urlkey': u'highly-sensitive-people', u'id': 37553}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Personality Type', u'urlkey': u'personality-type', u'id': 46145}, {u'name': u'Myers Briggs Type Indicator', u'urlkey': u'myers-briggs-type-indicator', u'id': 113453}, {u'name': u'Introverts meeting friends', u'urlkey': u'introverts-meeting-friends', u'id': 685872}, {u'name': u'Personal Growth and MBTI', u'urlkey': u'personal-growth-and-mbti', u'id': 1469582}]"

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"

Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,"<p>Ages 18+</p>
<p>This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.</p>
<p>I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge &amp; information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on. ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Step/dp/1497584566"">Overcoming Social Anxiety: Step by Step</a>"" is a great book and manual on how to remove anxiety. There's also an&nbsp;<a href=""https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety"">audio-series</a> of the book with some extra features. I'm not affiliated with this program and book.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p> Behavioral activities we'll engage in:</p>
<p>- Reading out loud to others</p>
<p>- Small talk practice</p>
<p>- Speaking in front of the group</p>
<p>- Learning to say 'No' assertiveness</p>
<p>- Goofy Skits</p>
<p>- Pro-activity reports</p>

Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group. <br></p>

Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,"<p>This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.</p>
<p>The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.</p>
<p>We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.</p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Alternative Medicine', u'urlkey': u'alternative-medicine', u'id': 17150}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}]"

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"
A Confidential Therapy Group for Women!,"<p>Welcome! This wonderful, confidential therapy group is facilitated by local clinical psychologist Carla Marie Manly, Ph.D. The group focuses on a variety of important issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and isolation. The group provides support and encouragement during life transitions such as divorce, relationship changes, and career changes. We work on setting and achieving personal goals within a positive, meaningful framework. The group provides a safe place for women of all ages to build their confidence, receive feedback, and find inner strength by sharing with other women in a safe and peaceful environment. This group also offers skill-building and strategies to help women cope with life stresses and challenges. This group is limited to 7 members and is ongoing on a weekly basis. The fee is $25.00 per session.</p>
<p>At the start of each group, each member has an opportunity to check in and discuss current challenges and concerns in a supportive and encouraging environment. We address a wide variety of important topics such as anxiety, depression, isolation, relationship concerns, and low self-esteem. Compassionate, therapeutic insights are offered to promote healing, self-awareness, and positive changes. We focus on understanding and utilizing practical strategies to improve self-confidence, coping skills, and interpersonal relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>As we move through various topics, you'll find that your inner awareness and strength grows. You will come away from each session with a better understanding of yourself and how you interact with others. You'll find encouragement in meeting with other women whose life experiences illuminate your own struggles. A sense of vital interconnection develops as you realize that your own insights and experiences also benefit others! The group discussions change as we move forward, and the themes will evolve naturally as life circumstances change.<em><strong>The ultimate goal is to help each woman create the joy-filled, passionate life of her dreams!</strong></em></p>

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>

Let Go of Your Past and Make New Positive Friends,"<p>All of the meetups for this group will take place at the local Church of Scientology, where I am a volunteer. You can be of any religion to come. For example, I'm a Buddhist myself. You are not expected to change your religion here.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Have you been through stressful past situations, and you want to mentally move on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are you interested in building new and strong relationships?</p>

<p>Having been a life improvement consultant at a non-profit organization for over 20 years, I know one of the reasons people cannot be positive is because they are tied down by their traumatic experiences.&nbsp; It's hard to be healthy mentally when you are reeling from your past upsets.&nbsp; Therefore, part of our activities in our meetups will be discussing ways to get over traumatic events, and, if you are willing, share some of your experiences with the other members.</p>
<p>Another reason people cannot move on is because they lack the relationship building or communication skills they need.&nbsp; For example, they may be introverted, uncomfortable talking with strangers, or do not seize opportunities to meaningfully connect with other people.&nbsp; Therefore, we will be discussing relationship building skills as well.</p>
<p>All of our meetup events will provide time for individual discussions, so members can share their deep thoughts and personal experiences.&nbsp; Typically, we'll have one meetup per week, and the first hour of the meetup will be a workshop to learn some tools for how to let go of the past and make new friends, and the second hour will be for individual discussions.&nbsp; All the meetup events for this group are free, and members are encouraged to bring friends. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested, join this group now. For any questions, please call Tony the Organizer at (916) 519-5287.</p>

Union City from anxiousness to peace of mind,"<p>if you suffer from any kind of anxiety affecting your focus and concentration that you feel like you are loosing control at time, then this group is for you. Whether it be work anxiety, emotional mental anxiety or physical panic attacks, you have to get your control and power back.

Now, I am so grateful that I have fully overcome this challenge and now living with power and peace of mind. To give back, I have created this talk group to help you go from being overwhelmingly anxious to having clarify, freedom and peace of mind in your daily dealings of life. You have much more to give, and much more to focus on. Ditch the anxiety, and choose a life of power, clarity and freedom.

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>
<p>*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears.

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>

Sober and Socially Awkward,"<p>How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?</p>
<p>For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human. &nbsp;I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. </p>
<p>I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.</p>
<p>I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.</p>
<p>By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.</p>
<p>For 5 years, I have done it alone. &nbsp;It fucking sucks.</p>
<p>The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. </p>
<p>I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication. &nbsp;This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.</p>

The intention is to create a safe space for people suffering from anxiety, depression, or PTSD, either directly or indirectly, to express, find an outlet, and acquire a circle of support as they continue their own journey in overcoming their struggles.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety and Depression', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-and-depression', u'id': 1509480}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"
recreational support group for mental well-being.,"<p>Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness. We ourselves are the most intuitive of our body, thoughts, and emotions. Together, by sharing fun, love, and understanding from the community, we can empower ourselves and learn to see our unique sensitivities as strengths.</p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Yoga', u'urlkey': u'yoga', u'id': 244}, {u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Meditation', u'urlkey': u'meditation', u'id': 1322}, {u'name': u'Art', u'urlkey': u'art', u'id': 1502}, {u'name': u'Psychiatric Disorders', u'urlkey': u'mentalill', u'id': 6619}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Artists', u'urlkey': u'boston-artists', u'id': 16573}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}]"

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"

Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,"<p>Ages 18+</p>
<p>This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.</p>
<p>I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge &amp; information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on. ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Step/dp/1497584566"">Overcoming Social Anxiety: Step by Step</a>"" is a great book and manual on how to remove anxiety. There's also an&nbsp;<a href=""https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety"">audio-series</a> of the book with some extra features. I'm not affiliated with this program and book.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p> Behavioral activities we'll engage in:</p>
<p>- Reading out loud to others</p>
<p>- Small talk practice</p>
<p>- Speaking in front of the group</p>
<p>- Learning to say 'No' assertiveness</p>
<p>- Goofy Skits</p>
<p>- Pro-activity reports</p>
<p>- Impromptu presentation talks</p>
<p>- Mock job interviews</p>

Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>

Nourish Heal Transform (NHT)-Anxiety & Addiction Support,"<p>Have you had enough of your anxiety and/or addictions dictating your life? Sacramento NHT is a new meetup group for those who are ready to learn new skills and gain new insights on how to stop suffering and start living a wholehearted balanced life. We will meet for 1 hour on the last Tuesday of each month at 6pm to discuss overcoming addictions and anxiety with the use of dietary strategies, targeted nutrients, and lifestyle modifications led by a therapist/ certified nutritionist. In addition, we will have a professional yoga instructor do some very gentle stress reducing yoga for a few minutes. Topics such as, ""Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medication)- will they cure my chronic anxiety?; Breaking up with sugar- will this lead to improvements with my anxiety and addictions?; Powerful nutrients to banish cravings; What are you really hungry for?; Is your fixed mindset sabotaging your health goals?; Food and mood, is there a connection?; and so much more! &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>The monthly group meetings are for educational and inspirational purposes only and are not meant to be a situation where you will feel compelled to divulge personal information. However, this is a safe place for you to share as much as you are comfortable with sharing.</p> 
<p>The goal of the group is for you to leave the meeting feeling more relaxed than when you arrived and to take a tool or insight you can use right away.</p> 
<p>In addition to our monthly meetings we will schedule socials such as hikes, fun runs, movie nights, charity events, potlucks, etc as a means of building a community and connections with others who can relate to your struggles. Healthy connections with others is the antidote to addiction and self-sabotaging behaviors.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Nutrition', u'urlkey': u'nutrition', u'id': 10161}, {u'name': u'Support and Recovery', u'urlkey': u'support-and-recovery', u'id': 17966}, {u'name': u'Healthy Eating', u'urlkey': u'healthy-eating', u'id': 19630}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Overcoming Addictions', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-addictions', u'id': 99170}]"
Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,"<p>This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.</p>
<p>The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation.

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"
Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>

Sober and Socially Awkward,"<p>How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?</p>
<p>For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human. &nbsp;I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. </p>
<p>I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.</p>
<p>I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.</p>
<p>By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.</p>
<p>For 5 years, I have done it alone. &nbsp;It fucking sucks.</p>
<p>The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. </p>
<p>I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication. &nbsp;This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.</p>

<p>how to meet people, how to express yourself, how to start romantic relationships, etc. Even public speaking!

The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.</p>
<p>I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge &amp; information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on. ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Step/dp/1497584566"">Overcoming Social Anxiety: Step by Step</a>"" is a great book and manual on how to remove anxiety. There's also an&nbsp;<a href=""https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety"">audio-series</a> of the book with some extra features. I'm not affiliated with this program and book.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p> Behavioral activities we'll engage in:</p>
<p>- Reading out loud to others</p>
<p>- Small talk practice</p>
<p>- Speaking in front of the group</p>
<p>- Learning to say 'No' assertiveness</p>
<p>- Goofy Skits</p>
<p>- Pro-activity reports</p>
<p>- Impromptu presentation talks</p>
<p>- Mock job interviews</p>
<p>- Much much more in the safety of the group!</p>

<p>The group organizer, Ronnie, has social anxiety like everyone else in here. He's just a regular man looking to better himself and anyone else that wants to reach the finish line with him. He's not a doctor or psychologist and does not offer professional medical advice. This group is for him as much as it is for you.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Communication Skills', u'urlkey': u'communication-skills', u'id': 20923}, {u'name': u'Introverted', u'urlkey': u'introverted', u'id': 21341}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'overcoming social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-social-anxiety', u'id': 89785}, {u'name': u'Shyness', u'urlkey': u'shy', u'id': 414252}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"
Mind Power Development Meetup,"<p>This is a group for people who are interested in developing their mind power in a methodical and effective way.</p>
<p>I notice that the problems people have with their mind include difficulties with self-confidence, communication skills, lack of focus, and anxiety, so this group will target remedying these difficulties. If our members want to work on other difficulties or issues, we can do so by request as well.</p>
<p>I have been a counselor at a non-profit organization for over twenty years now, and I am particularly fond of some powerful tools which work on everybody but are not generally known or applied.</p>
<p>We'll do some serious self improvement in this group. I'll provide the framework for our members to meet and learn together. We'll have free weekly meetings at the Dianetics &amp; Scientology Life Improvement Center in Sacramento, near Marconi and Watt. Hopefully we'll change some lives as a result of our activities.</p>
<p>If you are interested in using the power of your mind more effectively, join this group now. If you have any questions, feel free to call me (Tony, Group Organizer) at 916-519-5287.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Professional Development', u'urlkey': u'prodev', u'id': 3880}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Communication Skills', u'urlkey': u'communication-skills', u'id': 20923}, {u'name': u'Mind', u'urlkey': u'mind', u'id': 21548}, {u'name': u'Confidence Building', u'urlkey': u'confidence-building', u'id': 25220}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Discover the power of your mind', u'urlkey': u'discover-the-power-of-your-mind', u'id': 62802}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}, {u'name': u'overcoming social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-social-anxiety', u'id': 89785}]"
San Jose Anxiety & Depression Social Support Group,"<p><span>We typically get together on Sunday afternoon about twice a month and chat at a park in San Jose and possible future events in the Fremont area as well. This is an informal group not facilitated by a Licensed mental health professional, just peer run. If this sounds like a meetup you would like to attend, please join.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>
<br>
<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>
<p>Steve has presented an initial idea for forming smaller support groups. &nbsp;The idea, and ongoing discussion about it can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Marin-Depression-Meetup/messages/boards/thread/50648925"">What's the plan?</a></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}, {u'name': u'Overcoming Depression', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-depression', u'id': 116438}, {u'name': u'Shyness', u'urlkey': u'shy', u'id': 414252}]"

Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,"<p>This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.</p>
<p>The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.</p>
<p>We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.</p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Alternative Medicine', u'urlkey': u'alternative-medicine', u'id': 17150}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}]"

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>
<p>*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears. I am open to suggestions for meetups including joint meetups with groups that would be sensitive to socially anxious people.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'overcoming social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-social-anxiety', u'id': 89785}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}]"

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"
Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,"<p>Ages 18+</p>
<p>This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.</p>
<p>I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge &amp; information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on. ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Step/dp/1497584566"">Overcoming Social Anxiety: Step by Step</a>"" is a great book and manual on how to remove anxiety. There's also an&nbsp;<a href=""https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety"">audio-series</a> of the book with some extra features. I'm not affiliated with this program and book.</p>

<p> Behavioral activities we'll engage in:</p>
<p>- Reading out loud to others</p>
<p>- Small talk practice</p>
<p>- Speaking in front of the group</p>

It is VITAL that you RSVP if you plan on attending, and if you change your mind, to change your RSVP to no if you cannot. We make reservations at local restaurants based on RSVPs, and need to ensure good will with our local business owners! This support group is specifically targeted for parents of teens who have autistic spectrum disorders (HFA, AS, NLD, PDD-NOS), pervasive mood disorders (bipolar), attention deficit disorders, or severe learning disorders -- high functioning enough to have been at least partially mainstreamed in school, but who are not able to move out on their own without help and guidance. Occasionally, we will have special events as needed or requested. Stay tuned, and welcome to our group!

San Mateo Depression & Anxiety Support Group,"<p>Anyone and everyone affected by mental illness. This meetup will get together and offer support to those affected by mental illness. Individuals will be free to share ""their stories"" or just listen to others who are willing to share. Collaborative brain-storming will be facilitated as mental illness is effectively dealt with in a variety of ways. In the beginning this group will focus mainly on support and collective brain-storming in order to assist anyone affected by mental health. As the group grows it is possible that a 12 step model similar to that used by AA could be implemented where ""sponsors"" (those who currently deal with or those who have dealt successfully with the challenges presented by their own mental health issues) are assigned to individuals to help guide them on their journey to a better life.</p>","[{u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Bipolar and Depression', u'urlkey': u'bipolar-and-depression', u'id': 60508}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}]"
recreational support group for mental well-being.,"<p>Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness. We ourselves are the most intuitive of our body, thoughts, and emotions. Together, by sharing fun, love, and understanding from the community, we can empower ourselves and learn to see our unique sensitivities as strengths.</p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Yoga', u'urlkey': u'yoga', u'id': 244}, {u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Meditation', u'urlkey': u'meditation', u'id': 1322}, {u'name': u'Art', u'urlkey': u'art', u'id': 1502}, {u'name': u'Psychiatric Disorders', u'urlkey': u'mentalill', u'id': 6619}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Artists', u'urlkey': u'boston-artists', u'id': 16573}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}]"

recreational support group for mental well-being.,"<p>Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness. We ourselves are the most intuitive of our body, thoughts, and emotions. Together, by sharing fun, love, and understanding from the community, we can empower ourselves and learn to see our unique sensitivities as strengths.</p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Yoga', u'urlkey': u'yoga', u'id': 244}, {u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Meditation', u'urlkey': u'meditation', u'id': 1322}, {u'name': u'Art', u'urlkey': u'art', u'id': 1502}, {u'name': u'Psychiatric Disorders', u'urlkey': u'mentalill', u'id': 6619}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Artists', u'urlkey': u'boston-artists', u'id': 16573}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}]"

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>
<p>Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.</p>
<p>You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.<span><br></span></p>

Bay Area Not So Spontaneous Slackers,"<p>Do you ever want to do something, but you don't know what? Do you ever want to get out of the house, meet new people, start living your life, but you decide to think about it after the next episode of Pawn Stars is over? Do you sign up for meetup groups, vow to go to the next meetup, but by the time the meetup day comes you opt out because it's been 2 weeks and you don't feel like going anymore? If so, then you're a spontaneous slacker like me. We work best when we don't have too much time to think about what the meetup is going to be like. We are looking for meetup activities, any and all, within the week, or even a day or two. In short - the less time between your sign up and the meetup, the more likely you are to attend. All are welcome. It's my belief that it's not what you do but whom you do it with that counts. So let us meet you; don't deprive us of your awesomeness. This group will work best for you when you participate in it. Suggest meetups, email me your ideas of things you want to see in the group, and most of all - come hang out!</p>","[{u'name': u'Bicycling', u'urlkey': u'bike', u'id': 579}, {u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Walking', u'urlkey': u'walkers', u'id': 933}, {u'name': u'Slackers', u'urlkey': u'slackers', u'id': 2021}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Hanging Out', u'urlkey': u'hanging-out', u'id': 28172}, {u'name': u'Spontaneous Fun', u'urlkey': u'spontaneous-fun', u'id': 30449}, {u'name': u'last minute', u'urlkey': u'last-minute', u'id': 35925}, {u'name': u""Let's Just Hang Out"", u'urlkey': u'lets-just-hang-out', u'id': 39468}, {u'name': u'Biking on Park Trails', u'urlkey': u'biking-on-park-trails', u'id': 74192}, {u'name': u'Trying New Things with Like Minded People!', u'urlkey': u'trying-new-things-with-like-minded-people', u'id': 140995}, {u'name': u'Shyness', u'urlkey': u'shy', u'id': 414252}, {u'name': u'Driving and Riding Scenic Roads', u'urlkey': u'driving-and-riding-scenic-roads', u'id': 441582}, {u'name': u'Any spontaneous fun suggestions!', u'urlkey': u'any-spontaneous-fun-suggestions', u'id': 1028392}]"

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>
<br>
<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

San Mateo Depression & Anxiety Support Group,"<p>Anyone and everyone affected by mental illness. This meetup will get together and offer support to those affected by mental illness. Individuals will be free to share ""their stories"" or just listen to others who are willing to share. Collaborative brain-storming will be facilitated as mental illness is effectively dealt with in a variety of ways. In the beginning this group will focus mainly on support and collective brain-storming in order to assist anyone affected by mental health. As the group grows it is possible that a 12 step model similar to that used by AA could be implemented where ""sponsors"" (those who currently deal with or those who have dealt successfully with the challenges presented by their own mental health issues) are assigned to individuals to help guide them on their journey to a better life.</p>","[{u'name': u'Bipolar Disorder', u'urlkey': u'bipolar', u'id': 892}, {u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Bipolar and Depression', u'urlkey': u'bipolar-and-depression', u'id': 60508}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}]"

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>
<p>*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears. I am open to suggestions for meetups including joint meetups with groups that would be sensitive to socially anxious people.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'overcoming social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-social-anxiety', u'id': 89785}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}]"
Marin Depression Meetup,"<p>This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.</p>
<p>Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.</p>
<p>Steve has presented an initial idea for forming smaller support groups. &nbsp;The idea, and ongoing discussion about it can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Marin-Depression-Meetup/messages/boards/thread/50648925"">What's the plan?</a></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}, {u'name': u'Mental Health Support', u'urlkey': u'mental-health-support', u'id': 69470}, {u'name': u'Depression  Support Group', u'urlkey': u'depression-support-group', u'id': 73619}, {u'name': u'Depression Support', u'urlkey': u'depression-support', u'id': 85140}, {u'name': u'Overcoming Depression', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-depression', u'id': 116438}, {u'name': u'Shyness', u'urlkey': u'shy', u'id': 414252}]"
Sober and Socially Awkward,"<p>How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?</p>
<p>For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human. &nbsp;I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. </p>
<p>I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.</p>
<p>I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.</p>
<p>By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.</p>
<p>For 5 years, I have done it alone. &nbsp;It fucking sucks.</p>
<p>The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. </p>
<p>I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication. &nbsp;This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.</p>

<p>how to meet people, how to express yourself, how to start romantic relationships, etc. Even public speaking!

East Bay INFJs For Friendship (20s-30s),"<p>East Bay INFJs For Friendship was founded to create relaxing and comfortable hang outs for INFJs from around the East Bay. Bonding over our NiFe traits and building quality friendships is our mission. Let's put in our warm efforts to make sure there will be plenty of support to go around.</p>
<p>Being an INFJ can be exhausting. There's a big brain and big heart in you, always fighting for control. You feel so much empathy and are so giving to others that sometimes, you need space to recharge and for folks to respect your personal bubble.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You want others to understand that, even though you may be soft-spoken, your usual banter is just the tip of the iceberg, and there's a whole world of creativity and thoughtfulness inside waiting to be discovered by the right person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You find yourself a humanitarian and a skeptic.</span></p>
<p><span>You are extremely idealistic with a tragic twist.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>You are very logical but deeply emotional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You want to be freely expressive of your feelings and your complex thoughts without being misunderstood or judged.</span></p>
<p><span>You feel like a walking contradiction all the time and yet everything makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<p><span>You're at a loss to explain your philosophies to most people so a lot of the time you just listen.</span></p>
<p><span>Your empathy allows you to easily tune in to how others are feeling.</span></p>
<p>You are introverted and keep to yourself but crave a genuine bond.</p>
<p>You finally sum up your spirit to go out and mingle, and then when you're actually outside you want to come back home.</p>
<p>If you can relate to any of the above traits of INFJs, this is the group for you. With your inclusion, let's create a fun-filled, positive social environment for everyone to bond.&nbsp;<span>Here we value respectful, kind friendships with our INFJs.&nbsp;</span></p>

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"

Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group. <br></p>

Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,"<p>This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.</p>
<p>The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.</p>
<p>We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.</p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good.</p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Alternative Medicine', u'urlkey': u'alternative-medicine', u'id': 17150}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Healing Depression and Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'healing-depression-and-anxiety', u'id': 48132}]"

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>
<p>*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears.

Sober and Socially Awkward,"<p>How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?</p>
<p>For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human. &nbsp;I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. </p>
<p>I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.</p>
<p>I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.</p>
<p>By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.</p>
<p>For 5 years, I have done it alone. &nbsp;It fucking sucks.</p>
<p>The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. </p>
<p>I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication. &nbsp;This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.</p>

Mind Power Development Meetup,"<p>This is a group for people who are interested in developing their mind power in a methodical and effective way.</p>
<p>I notice that the problems people have with their mind include difficulties with self-confidence, communication skills, lack of focus, and anxiety, so this group will target remedying these difficulties. If our members want to work on other difficulties or issues, we can do so by request as well.</p>
<p>I have been a counselor at a non-profit organization for over twenty years now, and I am particularly fond of some powerful tools which work on everybody but are not generally known or applied.</p>
<p>We'll do some serious self improvement in this group. I'll provide the framework for our members to meet and learn together.

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>

East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,"<p>Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.</p>
<p>*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears.

East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,"<p>Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.</p>
<p>This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'generalized-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 15092}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'anxiety/social anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-social-anxiety', u'id': 1510058}]"
Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,"<p>Ages 18+</p>
<p>This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.</p>
<p>I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge &amp; information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on. ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Step/dp/1497584566"">Overcoming Social Anxiety: Step by Step</a>"" is a great book and manual on how to remove anxiety. There's also an&nbsp;<a href=""https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social-anxiety-treatment/online-therapy/overcoming-social-anxiety"">audio-series</a> of the book with some extra features. I'm not affiliated with this program and book.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p> Behavioral activities we'll engage in:</p>
<p>- Reading out loud to others</p>
<p>- Small talk practice</p>
<p>- Speaking in front of the group</p>
<p>- Learning to say 'No' assertiveness</p>
<p>- Goofy Skits</p>
<p>- Pro-activity reports</p>
<p>- Impromptu presentation talks</p>
<p>- Mock job interviews</p>
<p>- Much much more in the safety of the group!</p>

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

Daughters of Borderline Mothers,"<p>This a group for any woman who considers herself to be a daughter of a borderline mother. I am planning on having this group meet once a month.

<p>I am not a trained therapist, and I am not intending for this to take the place of any therapy.

<p>This style of meditation has been practiced for 2,600 years.&nbsp; <br> Although the fundamentals of this practice are rooted in Buddhism, our group has no particular religious affiliations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mindfulness teaches us about ourselves, our thoughts, our emotions and how and why we experience our lives the way we do. Through this awareness, we can experience our lives more fully and live our lives on our terms instead of habitually reacting to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technique also has wonderful physical benefits in addition to leading to inner peace and happiness. <br> <br> We offer drop in group meditation (Shoshin or Beginners Mind) each Wednesday morning. The group organizer, Karen Miller, is available by appointment for individual or group instruction. <br></p>
<p>The 'Shoshin""meditations are designed for beginners in mind but are equally beneficial for experienced practitioners. <span>Shoshin (Beginners Mind) Group Meditation: Wednesday mornings @ 9:45-11:00</span></p>

Living & Trusting The Law of Attraction,"In this inspirational uplifting group, we will include the power of intention along with the law of attraction and the power of partnership to create miraculous results in our lives. We will play with actively moving from fear to love and trust, and explore how to improve our lives and the lives of others through positive thinking, good feeling, intentionality and aligned action. Our meetings will include motivational movies or CD excerpts from various progressive thinkers and teachers, insightful experiential exercises, enlightening group processes and opportunities to share, connect with and support each other.

Challenging times call us to sharpen our focus, clarify our intention, take action consistent with our deepest desires and to surrender to trusting Spirit and Law of attraction like never before. They also call us to leave our houses and entrenched fearful minds, to reach out and empower each other in the deepest, most meaningful and impactful ways. Believe me, there are people making lots of money right now, experiencing profound health, joyous relationships and wondrous living, and you can too!

Meditation journeys take many forms, and each class is truly a unique and wonderful experience. Learn techniques for adjusting your perspective of your life path. When you change your view, you are empowered to change your destination. Whatever you focus upon, that is where you will land - ask any hang-glider what method they use to assure a smooth landing - don't look at the obstacles, but the possibilities.</p>

<p>Meet others who are gathering for education, support, advice and safe companionship, in the many topics of self-improvement. Come join us, as we delve into and explore meaningful life topics which focus on improving the experience of Life.</p>
<p>Topics of the day include: self-esteem, relationships, goal setting, handling emotions, managing pain, or addressing barriers to success. We will look at research, case studies, demonstrations and sometimes various pertinent media. We regularly do exercises to experience the first steps towards creating our transformed and improved selves. We will be introduced to techniques that can transform ADD into more focus, transform Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder or Anxiety into calm certainty, change a roller-coastering life into more calmness and stability, or workshop on getting our lives out of a rut and progressing.</p>
<p>Real help is possible, as a few of us have experienced. Free support group meetings conducted by professional Mind-Body-Spirit counselors who care. Friends and family are also welcome. ______________________________________________________________</p>

Oakland LifeFire Laughter Yoga,"<p>Want to jumpstart your joy? Join us and get happified!</p>
<p>The global Laughter Yoga movement was started by Dr. Madan Kataria, an MD from India, in 1995. There are now over 6000 ""Laughter Clubs"" in over 70 countries around the world spreading peace and joy through laughter! <br> <br>Laughter Yoga does not use the familiar ""Hatha Yoga"" poses or asanas. It is not based on humor or jokes, which are very subjective. Rather it combines playful, easy laughter exercises with yogic breathing and a final relaxation. And like yoga it IS a ""practice"", also called ""intentional laughter"", that taps into the mind-body connection to lift your mood, reduce stress, lower blood pressure and boost your immune system while you have fun. After laughing and playing with this fabulous group, you will leave energized and relaxed. How cool is that!</p>
<p>Oakland LIfefire Laughter Yoga was started in 2007&nbsp;by Annie Goglia, a certified Laughter Yoga Teacher and Life Coach.&nbsp;Annie loves&nbsp;to share&nbsp;her laughter with others with an open heart. She&nbsp;was trained by the founder of Laughter Yoga, Dr. Kataria. In 2013, Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Liz Nichols joined her as co-leader. <br></p>
<p>We are usually a mix of ""regulars"" and newcomers. Drop-ins are super-welcome. No mats needed. Adults and older teens of all levels of physically fitness are welcome. Wear comfortable clothing for easier laughing.</p>
<p><strong>Laughing with others is priceless. Oakland LifeFire Laughter Meetups are free! We welcome donations to help with our costs. You can click on the ""chip in"" button on the left, or bring your donation when you come to a Meetup.</strong></p>

Jeet Kune Do/Kali Fierce Egalitarians,"<p>""What would happen if a year-old baby fell from a fourth-floor window onto the head of a burly truck driver, standing on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Even an innocent little baby can become a dangerous missile WHEN ITS BODY-WEIGHT IS SET INTO FAST MOTION.</p>
<p>You may feel as helpless as a year-old infant-as far as fighting is concerned; but please remember: (1) YOU WEIGH MORE THAN A BABY, and (2) YOU NEED NOT FALL FROM A WINDOW TO PUT YOUR BODY-WEIGHT INTO MOTION.</p>

Milpitas Yoga Meditation Mind-Body Wellness Group,"<p><span style=""font-size : medium""><strong>-- No Breath No Life, Know Breath Know Life --</strong></span></p>
<p>Welcome! We are a group of people who learn and practice the Yoga of Breath as a means to total wellness of a healthy body and a stress-free mind. Beginners, intermediate practitioners, seasoned yogis ... all are part of this group.</p>
<p>The first act we do in our life is to breathe in. And the last act of our life is to breathe out. Between this first breath in and the last breath out are all the breaths that we call life. The breath is our best friend -- it's always with us. And yet, we hardly know much about it. What's more ... it holds some timeless secrets to our health, peace of mind, and well-being.</p>
<p>""There is a great secret in the breath. You have an in-built ability to calm the mind, heal the body, and energize the whole system in minutes. The secret is in the breath.""</p>
<p>With just a little practice it's easy to use your breath to instantly</p>
<ul>
<li>infuse your body with energy</li>
<li>detoxify through the breath</li>
<li>make your mind calm</li>
<li>control negative emotions</li>
<li>increase focus and concentration</li>
<li>create a sense of well-being</li>

Successful relationships also take skill. Skills like setting and enforcing boundaries, actively respecting yourself and others, knowing when and how to take care of yourself, being assertive--all play a part. I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist, and I realized I was teaching the same skills to all my clients. I created this class for my clients, their spouses, and others to accelerate their learning of crucial relationship skills at a low cost. Learn winning strategies and un-learn losing strategies in this eye-opening, interactive group. And if you're in therapy or working a 12-step program, this will definitely give your process a boost!

San Jose - Manjushri Lineage Buddhist Group,"<p>Hello<br> <br> LEARN, CONTEMPLATE, CULTIVATE and TRANSFORM.<br> <br> Welcome to the <span>meetup group</span> ""Inner Peace &amp; Happiness Buddhist Study and Meditation&nbsp;Group"". This is a wonderful opportunity, whether you are just beginning or have been studying for awhile, to join other warm-heart, sincere Buddhist Practitioners as we explore Mahayana &amp; Vajrayana Buddhism.<br> <br> Buddhism is about transforming the mind and discovering the path to true happiness. To achieve this, first we need to take focused action to uproot the negative emotions, destructive mental constructs, and negative habits that continually cause suffering for ourselves. We also need to cultivate virtues in our mind such as compassion, loving-kindness, and wisdom. This way we can transform ourselves to a point where we experience stability, peace of mind, and lightness within our own mind. This results in happiness for ourselves and others.<br> <br> Our group is under the guidance of our precious Lama Namnang Mingjo Dorje Rinpoche, a very humble yet immensely accomplished yogi, whose sincerity, dedication &amp; guidance is very inspiring &amp; brings the <span>Buddhist teachings</span> alive in our daily lives.<br> <br> The aim of our group is to provide our members with both an in-person as well as online learning environment to explore the incredible wisdom and application of Buddhism. We have on-going weekly teachings &amp; study groups that provide practitioners with an opportunity to not only learn <span>Buddhist philosophy</span>, helping us to better understand the interplay of cause and effect (the law of karma) and help us to contemplate and look at ways to change ourselves. As well as learn <span>Buddhist meditation practices</span> that help us to increase &amp; stabilize key virtues (charity, ethical discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom) within us, and give us a first-hand personal experience of what it is like to experience a mind that is stable, quiet, calm, peaceful, joyful and light.<br> <br> This is a very rare opportunity to study Buddhism in a beautiful blessed environment together with a group of sincere seekers. All of us are also searching and wishing to discover and nurture the essence of our Buddha potential. Come and join us. Absorb yourself in this incredible wisdom and create more inner-peace, stability, &amp; happiness in your mind, your life, &amp; your world! Seize the moment!</p>

"Reiki Tummo Healing, Heart Meditation & Natural Walking","<p>""All truth is in your heart, not in the physical heart, but in the core within yourself where your true self resides.

SpreadKindness.org,"<p>This group is for people who believe in practicing acts of kindness in everyday life. If we can get more people doing this then the world will become a happier place where peace and joy happen.</p>
<p>Join us as we inspire, enlighten, and make someone's day happy through sincere kindness of our hearts. Together we can make a world of difference- one person at a time. If you do one random act of kindness everyday it will put a smile on both your face and also on the face of the other person.</p>
<p>Location: This group will travel around the Bay Area to do&nbsp;acts of kindness&nbsp;for people, organizations, and individuals.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: You're likely to feel good and become addicted to practice acts of kindness everyday!</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves. &rdquo;</p>

The East Bay NLP Meetup Group,"<p>This is a Meet Up for people interested in Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).</p>
<p>NLP is called ""The Study of the Structure of Human Experience."" It is also a self development practice: Once we know something about how we structure our experience, we can find ways to re-structure it in ways that provide us with the experience of life we would prefer.</p>
<p>NLP is a remarkably elegant and deeply respectful set of tools to uncover unconscious beliefs and structures that determine our experience, and--again, at the unconcious level--introduce new beliefs and structures to our hidden selves.</p>
<p>At these meetups, we learn and practice NLP techniques, and learn about and discuss NLP principles and frameworks. We have had a number of meetups so far and they have let people practice NLP skills in a relaxed, fun environment. We've had everyone from experienced practitioners to those just starting out.</p>
<p>For those of you who know something about NLP, we've worked on anchoring, rapport, language patterns, parts work, and much more. So come and explore!</p>","[{u'name': u'Hypnosis', u'urlkey': u'hypnosis', u'id': 2521}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'NLP Practice Group', u'urlkey': u'nlp-practice-group', u'id': 32273}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)', u'urlkey': u'nlp-neurolinguistic-programming', u'id': 43763}]"

The Shadow Effect Meet Up,"<p>
  <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
  <strong>What is the Shadow?</strong>
</p>
<p>The shadow contains all the parts of ourselves that we try to hide, deny or suppress. It is the keeper of all the aspects of ourselves that we dislike and the qualities that we judge as unacceptable. The shadow wears many faces: angry, critical, fearful, lazy, controlling, selfish, weak, pathetic&hellip; These are the faces we don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t want to show the world and the faces we don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t want to show ourselves. Most of us expend huge amounts of energy trying to get rid of or control these unwanted aspects of ourselves. We hope that by hiding or fixing our 
<span>""</span>bad qualities
<span>""</span> we will have the peace, success and happiness we desire. Most of us are convinced that we are flawed and inadequate so we become masters of disguise, and go to great lengths to hide our bad qualities from those around us &ndash; even from ourselves.</p>
<p>The result of turning our backs on our dark side? A life that slips by only half lived. Dreams that are never realized, or worse, that lay buried under years of resignation and shame. Until we make peace with our shadow we will continue to be at war with ourselves. And our outer world will mirror our inner struggle. What we resist persists &ndash; and we will create and attract from others that which we most dislike in ourselves. Until we feel authentic compassion for each and every aspect of ourselves, we will continue to draw forth people and events that will mirror the negative feelings we have about ourselves. Until we take back our power and forgive ourselves for being human we will attract people who push our buttons and reactivate our emotional wounds. And until we find the courage to love ourselves completely, we will never truly be able to experience the love from those around us. We don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t need to guess how we really feel about ourselves at the deepest level. All we have to do is look at how the outer world treats us. If we
<span>&rsquo;</span>re not getting the respect, love and appreciation we desire from the outer world, it
<span>&rsquo;</span>s more than likely we aren
<span>&rsquo;</span>t giving these things to ourselves. This is the benevolence of the Universe in action. The whole world is a mirror of our own consciousness, and when we make peace with the disowned aspects of ourselves, we make peace with the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <strong>The Shadow Effect Movie</strong>
</p>
<p>The Shadow Effect, a visually stunning and cutting-edge documentary, will inspire you to step out of the self that you&rsquo;ve known and break free from the bonds of the past. Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Dr. David Simon, and other world-renowned thinkers join Debbie Ford to reveal the transformative power of your shadow&mdash;the parts of yourself that you dislike and disown, the past that you regret and repress, and the future that is waiting to be birthed. The Shadow Effect will leave you breathing deeper as you take back your power and step into the possibility of the next greatest evolution of yourself.

"Love, Intuition and Spirituality","<p>The purpose of this group is to learn how to live from love, and connect to your intuition and spirituality. There are only 2 basic emotions, fear and love. If you choose to live from love and inner wisdom, this meetup is for you.</p>
<p>Your intuition is how your higher self, your spirit, communicates with you. It is all wise, all knowing and all loving. It knows the past, present and future and is not programmed like the mind is. Everyone is intuitive. It comes with the human package. Only fears block it. Remove your fears and you can live as the master of your life!</p>
<p>Spirituality is living from love rather than fear. It is choosing to be the loving person you really are. Awaken to your true essence of love and your life can be amazing! It has helped me be healthier, happier, more successful, and fulfilled in every area of my life! And you can, too! Go for it!<br></p>
<p>The fun and profound events are healing and transformational, because the goal is to to help you to enjoy a peaceful, loving and joyful life. <br></p>
<p>As a licensed&nbsp; Marriage and Family Therapist, intuitive counselor, spiritual teacher/healer and author,&nbsp; I will be honored to support your connection to your wisdom, love and spirituality. <br></p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting you.</p>

Lean Culture,"<p>Lean startup is a startup methodology which aims to reduce the market risks and minimize capital requirements by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard to be lean?</p> 
<p>Lean is humble; it requires admitting that you don't know your market as well as you imagine.</p> 
<p>Lean is frugal; it entails making do with less or even with virtually nothing.</p> 
<p>Lean is disciplined; it requires us to focus on areas that are not our natural forte.</p> 
<p>What can entrepreneurs do to foster a lean culture?</p>

"I am Happy Project - Roseville, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees.

Santa Cruz Meditation Group,"<p>Healthy minds dance for joy! Come celebrate and explore the experiences of a lifetime! Meditate, dance, shake, visualize , draw, and talk to keep your mind and body in good health. Find the skills that work for you! <br> <br>This is the place where you get to try out different experiences from the field of Mind-Body Medicine. Mind-Body Medicine is an up and coming integrative health perspective. It links our overall health to the connection between our mind and body. Most people talk about the benefits of Mind-Body Medicine as learning skills for good health. Its true benefit to you is having <span><strong>experiences</strong></span> which positively affect you. The experience of participating with this group will positively change your understanding. You won't know what you've been missing until you try it. Similar experiences improved my outlook on life a thousand fold! I am healthier than I've ever been, where it really counts! in my head! The impact of this positive change in my life and everyone around me has been astonishing. Care to be astonished? <br> <br>I wish I could say that meditation is the best way to start. Its how I started, its what I'm best at, and its how I got to be here. After seeing the experiences others have had by participating in Mind-Body exercises I have to say its not! Mind-Body exercises work faster and are more fun! Meditation is the purest mental exercise though and can become a wonderful part of your life as well. This group will engage you on many levels from dancing for joy to the deepest meditative experience. <br> <br>Yeh! <br> <br>Outside of being a genius with a passion for this stuff, who am I? Professionally I am a civil engineer with 19 years of experience. I've loved playing sports my whole life. I am very competitive and fair! I am not affiliated with any religion. Malyn, co-organizer, is my girlfriend, she works professionally as a pediatrician. In addition to our personal experience we have both received training through the Center of Mind Body Medicine in Washington DC. As I mentioned earlier, this training provides alternatives to meditation that can achieve similar results, sometimes even faster than meditation! <br> <br>Background <br> <br>Meditation is a label for many activities which are universal to humanity. Even the simple act of conversing with another person can be a meditative experience. Physical relaxation can also coincide with a meditative experience. When I talk about meditation it includes these types of introductory experiences and more advanced skills. I started this group because I've benefited enormously from meditating, and it all began unknowingly; I didn't know I was meditating! To be honest, I just wanted to be happy. I've discovered how to be happier, how to allow myself to be at my best without thinking about it. Everyone wants to know the answer, How? The secret is...this gritty stuff called emotions. Emotions are there to help us, not just some emotions, all of them. The more this is understood, the more beautiful life becomes. For many people, there are times emotions do not help, its these that can be transformed. Emotions are difficult to work with by their very nature. The group is intended to provide an environment to help you with these in the best possible way, have some fun, share some stories, relax, and also work through some of those emotions. Not me you might say? How can you afford the time? How can you not? What would you give to be happier every day for the rest of your life? I just wish I had figured this stuff out sooner! The goal is to create habitual positive experiences, as natural as brushing your teeth before you go to bed. The result? Living more beautifully with each passing day. <br> <br>Although I love to use positive words like happiness and beauty when thinking about this stuff, understand this isn't about focusing on being happy, to the detriment of your emotional range, sadness, anger, grief. Its about changing your perspective and experience of living, so that you experience the best possible emotion for the moment you are in. Its not about ignoring the past or the future but finding a way to understand them in new ways. Its by experiencing transformations of perspective personally that change happens. Again, the secret is not to study, but to experience. In this group, the goal is to have a range of transformational experiences, some will incrementally affect you almost without notice, others will be immediately life altering. There are mind-body exercises which can lead to instantaneous transformational experiences and these will be used to augment the core mediation. The point is to set time aside to develop skills for making life easier, fuller, with more happiness, calm, and resilience. <br> <br>Yeh! Again!</p>","[{u'name': u'Meditation', u'urlkey': u'meditation', u'id': 1322}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Pain Management', u'urlkey': u'painmanage', u'id': 10429}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Enlightenment', u'urlkey': u'enlightenment', u'id': 16906}, {u'name': u'Living Beyond Fear', u'urlkey': u'living-beyond-fear', u'id': 27797}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Overcome Fears', u'urlkey': u'overcome-fears', u'id': 39224}, {u'name': u'Prostatitis', u'urlkey': u'prostatitis', u'id': 69152}, {u'name': u'Pelvic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'pelvic-disorders', u'id': 69153}]"
"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology.

A Confidential Therapy Group for Women!,"<p>Welcome! This wonderful, confidential therapy group is facilitated by local clinical psychologist Carla Marie Manly, Ph.D. The group focuses on a variety of important issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and isolation. The group provides support and encouragement during life transitions such as divorce, relationship changes, and career changes. We work on setting and achieving personal goals within a positive, meaningful framework. The group provides a safe place for women of all ages to build their confidence, receive feedback, and find inner strength by sharing with other women in a safe and peaceful environment. This group also offers skill-building and strategies to help women cope with life stresses and challenges. This group is limited to 7 members and is ongoing on a weekly basis. The fee is $25.00 per session.</p>
<p>At the start of each group, each member has an opportunity to check in and discuss current challenges and concerns in a supportive and encouraging environment. We address a wide variety of important topics such as anxiety, depression, isolation, relationship concerns, and low self-esteem. Compassionate, therapeutic insights are offered to promote healing, self-awareness, and positive changes. We focus on understanding and utilizing practical strategies to improve self-confidence, coping skills, and interpersonal relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>As we move through various topics, you'll find that your inner awareness and strength grows. You will come away from each session with a better understanding of yourself and how you interact with others. You'll find encouragement in meeting with other women whose life experiences illuminate your own struggles. A sense of vital interconnection develops as you realize that your own insights and experiences also benefit others! The group discussions change as we move forward, and the themes will evolve naturally as life circumstances change.<em><strong>The ultimate goal is to help each woman create the joy-filled, passionate life of her dreams!</strong></em></p>

Bay Area Sound Healing Group,"<p>Resonant Harmony Attunements</p>
<p>The Resonant Harmony Attunements are designed for two purposes:</p>
<p>1. To Create Community Where We are All Connected &ndash; When you share sound together, everyone's whole system shares the same vibration or frequency -- brainwaves, heart rates, and electromagnetic fields align, and we all become like family. In fact, sharing sound together is a portal to remembering the ultimate state of where we are all One -- particularly when the sound ends and we enter that divine place of peace where we disappear. We believe this is the ultimate goal, Oneness -- for when we exist in a world where we are all one there is no more conflict, no more war -- and only love and light permeate all of our relationships. Coming together in sound creates this Community, where we are all connected, one with all humanity and life --including everything on the planet.</p>
<p>2. To Bring Us into Higher States of Consciousness &ndash; A Higher Frequency - There are two general types of states: <br />a. A State of Bliss &ndash; Defining &ldquo;Bliss&rdquo; as any high state of consciousness &ndash; including that of Gratitude, Compassion, Joy, and Love (personal and Universal). This state could be simply Perfect Presence or simply just a sweet state of Well Being. Of course, music often takes us to such a place. It is even more powerful when the underlying sounds are also working towards inducing the same state, and when you include a powerful Intention. <br />b. A State of Deep Peace &ndash; Not just silence (because silence can be uncomfortable), but a place of peace like no other. It happens when the sound ends on the root, home note of the song and fades ever so slowly -- seamlessly melding into the silence. When this happens the last frequency heard remains in the room &ndash; humming ever so still. The slower the fade, the better.</p>
<p><br />The Events include many different Experiences. Sometimes a night might be devoted to one particular type of experience; Often we will have multiple experiences in one night:</p>
<p>1. Sound Healing Concerts &ndash; Wide variety of groups based around Sound Healing and Raising Consciousnes.</p>
<p>2. Sound Journeys &ndash; Experience the healing and consciousness raising aspects of sound as you lay on the floor with your eyes closed. We play a wide range of natural sounds all around you, including using the voice to induce higher states of consciousness. The journeys often include Crystal Bowls and Tibetan Bowls.</p>
<p>3. Toning with Intention &ndash; Most of our meditations are done with a conscious stated Intention. It is well-known and has been proven through research that Intention really does work.</p>

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

<p><span>Be sure to visit our <strong><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Earth-Wisdom-and-The-Michael-Teachings/messages/boards/"">DISCUSSION FORUM</a> </strong>between meetup groups for more information on The Michael Teachings, an excellent article on ""The History of Channeling"",&nbsp; inspirational quotes and messages, astrological forecasts, monthly trends and more.&nbsp; And, last but not least, please check out our <strong><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Earth-Wisdom-and-The-Michael-Teachings/calendar/"">CALENDAR</a></strong> for future meetup dates, times and locations, and for upcoming <strong>SPECIAL EVENTS</strong> that may be scheduled for this meetup group in the near future as well. <br> <br><strong><span>What Is This Meetup Group All About Anyway?</span></strong> <br> <br>This meetup group is based primarily upon the teachings of the ancient mid-causal plane entity teacher known simply as Michael, who was first popularized in the best-selling book, ""Messages from Michael"" by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro in the late 1970's. Many excellent books have since been published through numerous other Michael channels, adding depth, breadth and an ongoing evolution to the original channeled works. <br> <br>The Michael Teachings are a profoundly practical and directly applicable philosophy of life that sheds light upon the the nature of the self, one's relationships with others and on the workings underlying all life and the cosmos in general. It is a teaching designed for use and application on the physical plane, and is very grounded and geared to give each student a kind of map of the world from and through which they may more fully examine, evaluate and evolve their understanding of their own personal life experiences. <br> <br>A major part of Michael's teaching is concerned with reincarnation, its implications and ramifications. Part of this teaching is based upon a system of personality traits called ""overleaves"". Michael gave the information to increase our understanding of self and others, thereby improving the quality of life and relationships. Michael also intended the material be used to accelerate spiritual growth. <br> <br>This group is also based upon indigenous shamanic perspectives and practices from around the world, utilized in conjunction with the Michael Teachings perspective for an even deeper dive into the nature of your own personal reality and what makes YOU tick, from the inside, out. Working with our animal totems and learning about the traditional 9 Directions and the Michael Teachings 12 Support Circle functions are all included in the work I do with others both online and locally. <br> <br><strong>Who Is Michael?</strong> <br> <br>Michael is a collective consiousness comprised of approximately 1050 individual souls who have all completed their lifetimes on earth and have cycled off of the physical plane all together.&nbsp; They now teach as a recombined entity group from the causal plane perspective through various channels, bringing forth information to assist humanity along its spiritual path of life on the physical plane. <br> <br>Michael teaches that all is choice, that belief is not required, to test out and to question these teachings for yourself, and that personal validation of of one's own essence is the means by which humans progress themselves along the path of return to the Tao. Invalidation of essence serves only to retard and to inhibit such progress, according to Michael. The goal of these teachings is to develop an ever greater capacity for agage` and for unconditional love in our lives. They also offer their causal plane insights without expectation and with unconditional love and carry no expectations of their students, period. They simply offer insight as they see it and each person is free to use what they will and to discard the rest if it doesn't resonate or ring true for them personally.<em>&nbsp; (*Note: This entity group is NOT the Archangel Michael.)</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Who Would Enjoy Being Part of This Group? </strong> <br> <br>This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn more about themselves, their relationships with others, the underlying structure of life, the world in which we live and the universe in general.&nbsp; Bring yourself, your friends and your questions to an upcoming meetup and experience for yourself what this ancient, humorous and insightful causal plane teacher has to offer you along your own personal path of return to the Tao. <br> <br>I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you better through our regularly scheduled channeled meetup groups each month. Thank you for your interest in this group and I hope you will enjoy both the information and the comaraderie that you will find in our growing community.

Adapt Foundation,"<p>The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.</p>
<p>We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.</p>
<p>There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.</p>
<p>The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you.

<p>We are a group of practitioners following the teachings of the 85th Patriarch of the School of Chan, who dedicated his entire life to enable us to also be able to walk the path towards enlightenment.

<p>Each meeting follows a purposeful agenda geared toward bringing more business our members. Each Gold Star Member shares a 60-Second Infomercial about their products and services with the group. Guests are encouraged to share as well, provided there is no Member in the same business category.&nbsp;<span>Each meeting also includes a 10-minute business presentation by a group member, which is scheduled in advance. This lets members share about their products &amp; services, business philosophy and what makes them unique from the competition in a friendly, group setting.</span></p>
<p>Members are encouraged to attend the other 2 Gold Star Groups in our area (we call this Cross Clubbing) where they can make additional connections and share their business during 60-second infomercials, provided there is no member in the same category.</p>

Participants can find resolution to the places in life that are stuck, whether this is with success, romantic relationships, family, career or finances. When the family system is a good order, love flows to us and success comes to us. When the family system is stuck, life can be a struggle. The family system can be tangled from any unresolved trauma from past generations, known or unknown to members of the family. Unresolved trauma could be a sibling that died in childhood, a parent that lost their parent at an early age, a grandfather surviving WWII. The unresolved trauma lives on in the family soul. This can block us from success, health, romantic relationships, career and finances we desire in life. If you are experiencing blocks that you can't associate to anything specific, Or if you are experiencing blocks that stems from an undefined sadness, this group may be for you.

Bay Area Liberating Structures Community of Practice,"<p>Our intent: </p>
<br>
<p>The Bay Area Liberating Structures Community of Practice exists to support the community of people getting started and scaling up their use of Liberating Structures. LS make tiny shifts in the way we meet, plan, organize and decide. By dramatically increasing both the number of people involved and their engagement in solving complex problems, LS reliably generate better-than-expected results. The simplicity of the LS repertoire enables them to play well with other methods like change management, Agile, Lean and Design Thinking. Drawing inspiration from complexity science, Keith McCandless and Henri Lipmanowicz have made the entire repertoire available for non-commercial use through a Creative Commons license.</p>

Santa Cruz Evening Toastmasters - Est. 1991,"<p><b>Toastmasters</b> is the world's leading public speaking and leadership development program. Our <b>Evening Toastmasters Live Oak, Santa Cruz, California</b> meets every <b>Monday EVENING at 6:30PM</b>. <br></p>
<p>Our members DO NOT have to wake up at the crack of dawn to enjoy all that Toastmasters offers. <br></p>
<p>Most people associate the name Toastmasters with public speaking improvement training, but did you know that public speaking is only HALF of what we offer? <br></p>
<p><b>The Evening Toastmasters offers two parallel self improvement programs: </b> <br></p>
<p><b>Competent Communicator</b> - 10 standard projects which will incrementally improve and fine tune your presentation skills. You may move through your projects at your own comfortable pace. <br></p>
<p><b>Competent Leadership</b> - Ten Leadership projects which will improve and fine tune your listening and management skills. You can become a polished and more effective manager, business leader or entrepreneur at your own pace. <br></p>
<p><b>Evening Toastmasters</b> is a well established club having its beginnings in 1991. Founded by <b>Dan Robin</b>, <b>Steve Hardy</b> (still an active member) and a few others, including <b>Jim Griffin</b> from the <b>SCO Club</b> in Santa Cruz. Our club started at a little library room in Santa Cruz, and has now grown to occupy a very comfortable space in the <b>Live Oak Senior's Center at 1777 Capitola Road, Santa Cruz, CA 95062. </b> <br></p>
<p><b>Plenty of free parking and only a short walk from your car to our front door. <br></b></p>
<p>Enough about us, let's talk about<b> YOU! <br></b></p>
<p><b>What are YOUR personal improvement goals? </b> <br></p>
<p>Do you want to apply for an <b>advancement at work</b> which will require presentation skills? <br></p>
<p>Are you thinking of <b>starting your own company</b> and need to obtain funding? <br></p>
<p>Are you working at a non-profit and <b>need to apply for grant money</b> by making a powerful presentation? <br></p>
<p>Maybe you would like to feel more <b>comfortable in social settings.</b></p>
<p><b>Friend's wedding </b>coming up? Be the <b>Toastmaster</b> of that very special event!</p>
<p><b>We have helped our members achieve these goals and more. We WILL help YOU get there! </b> <br></p>

<p>Our club is very proud of our award winning history! We have been awarded Presidential Distinguished at least 3 times, and Select Distinguished several times over. <br></p>
<p>We have very active and experienced leadership. We have a well organized Mentorship program in our club. New members may choose to buddy up with an experienced member to ""learn the ropes"" as it were. Your mentor will provide as much personal guidance as you request. Then, when you are ready, you may become a Mentor and help one or more of the next group on their way to reaching their personal goals. <br></p>
<p>Now here's something we have not mentioned... <b>do you like to LAUGH and have FUN?</b></p>
<p>Our members <b>LOVE to laugh and have FUN! </b>We love to entertain and to be entertained! We are sometimes completely spontaneous and goofy!!! <br></p>

Lodi Toastmasters Meetup,"<p>Toastmasters is a place where you develop and grow - both personally and professionally. You join a community of learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations. You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively. Anyone who is a strong leader has to first be an effective communicator. In Toastmasters you will hone your speaking skills, and you will develop leadership abilities - through evaluations, listening, mentoring, serving as club officers and filling roles in club meetings. You will take those leadership skills out into the world, running businesses, mentoring youths, organizing fund-raisers, coaching teams and heading up families. By learning to effectively formulate, organize and express your ideas to others, you can achieve all kinds of success. You'll be more capable and confident when giving presentations. You'll be more persuasive when pitching prospective clients. Want to be better at negotiating your salary with your boss? Networking at business or social functions? Motivating co-workers - or your kids? We welcome you to join us at Lodi Toastmasters</p>

Corporate Leadership Development Meetup,"<p>Hello potential leaders,</p> 
<p>This is a group for you if you would like to develop your leadership skills. Transitioning from senior management of a company to leadership is not an easy transition. What I found is that to make the transition successfully, executives must navigate a tricky set of changes in their leadership focus and skills. They must learn to move from specialist to generalist, analyst to integrator, tactician to strategist, problem solver to agenda setter, warrior to diplomat.</p> 
<p>The agenda for this group would be to help each other through this transition. We would do that by sharing our experiences and learnings in the organizations we work for. This group is idea for those who are in management roles and would like to pursue leadership opportunities (VP, SVP, EVP, C-suite). This group is also for those who are in leadership roles and would like to grow further into those roles. Although age is no bar, it would be best if we target folks in 30s and early 40s age group.

Gold Star Referral Clubs Sacramento NOW Forming,"<p>Gold Star Referral Clubs are professional networking groups for local business people wanting to grow their business through referrals.</p> 
<p>The primary goal of the group is to build quality relationships, give solid referrals, and to support and learn from each other. This is done through weekly meetings and short, individual 1-to-1's where members learn more about each other's businesses &amp;amp; needs.</p> 
<p>Each meeting follows a purposeful agenda geared toward bringing more business our members. Each Gold Star Member shares a 60-Second Infomercial about their products and services with the group. Guests are encouraged to share as well, provided there is no Member in the same business category. Each meeting also includes a 10-minute business presentation by a group member, which is scheduled in advance. This lets members share about their products &amp;amp; services, business philosophy and what makes them unique from the competition in a friendly, group setting.</p> 
<p>Members are encouraged to attend the other Gold Star Groups in our area (we call this Cross Clubbing) where they can make additional connections and share their business during 60-second infomercials, provided there is no member in the same category.</p> 
<p>Gold Star Membership is available to men or women whose businesses are not in conflict with a current group member. Each Group is an independant Closed Category Group.<br>Guests may visit a Gold Star Group twice without joining - but since we are a Closed Category group, we encourage visitors to join promptly if their category is not yet taken.</p> 
<p>We are currently forming interest in the Sacramento area. We are looking for Club Directors and members. 1)Please join the group if you have interest in attending a meeting. 2)See more about becoming a member at www.goldstarreferral.com and on Facebook at ""Gold Star Referral Clubs Central Valley""</p>

South Bay Positive Psychology Salon,"<p>We all want to be happy, right? Are you interested in learning about what we know about thriving and achieving lasting happiness? Do you like the idea of exploring and achieving your full potential as a human being? Would you like to learn how to experience flow states and become more resilient in the face of life's obstacles?</p>
<p>If so, this is the right group for you! Each week Julie will lead a group discussion about a topic in positive psychology and personal development. This group is a place to learn how to thrive and also teach each other the methods that have worked for you. Positive psychology has three foundational areas of development: positive emotions, positive traits, and positive community engagement. * Positive emotions lead to a pleasant life experience. Germaine to this are things like development of contentment with your past, happiness in the here and now, and hope for your future. *Developing your positive individual traits will help you to lead a more engaged life and experience flow states (which are awesome!). To experience more of this we will explore our strengths and virtues, such as our capacity to love and be productive, and our potential to develop our full potential to be courageous, compassionate, resilient, creative, curious, in integrity, self-knowledgable, moderate, self-controlled, and wise. *Using our strengths to benefit our community and the world gives life meaning and purpose. We can develop our potential in this area by studying what meaning and purpose mean to us as individuals and how we can strive to use our strengths to improve our communities through our efforts in such areas as as social justice, personal responsibility, kindness &amp; compassion, parenting, nurturance of others, modeling a strong work ethic, developing out leadership abilities, promoting teamwork, building purpose, and sharing tolerance.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you and working together to discover where our potential can lead us!</p>

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>
<p>Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.</p>
<p>You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.<span><br></span></p>

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,"<p>This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! <b>Visit <a href=""http://eatlikeagoddess.com"">Eat LIke A Goddess now</a> for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body.</b></p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Law of Attraction', u'urlkey': u'lawofattraction', u'id': 3382}, {u'name': u'Nutrition', u'urlkey': u'nutrition', u'id': 10161}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Weight Loss Challenge', u'urlkey': u'weight-loss-challenge', u'id': 14998}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Weight Loss Support', u'urlkey': u'weight-loss-support', u'id': 15538}, {u'name': u'Healthy Eating', u'urlkey': u'healthy-eating', u'id': 19630}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'EFT for Stress Reduction/Release', u'urlkey': u'eft-for-stress-reduction-release', u'id': 43689}, {u'name': u'EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)', u'urlkey': u'eft-emotional-freedom-technique', u'id': 58052}, {u'name': u'Healthy Weight Loss', u'urlkey': u'healthy-weight-loss', u'id': 58776}]"

Exploring the Tools of Energy Psychology to Change Your Life,"<p>Energy Psychology (EP) consists of a number of holistic modalities that use a mind-body-spirit approach to healing. The premise is that any illness or dis-ease has physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components and that all of them need to be addressed for deep and complete healing to occur. On a basic level, everything is made of energy, including our bodies, so when imbalances or blockages in the energy flow occur they can result in any number of issues or problems, such as stress, anxiety, depression and more. EP tools are designed to identify and remove those blockages so that the body-mind-spirit can heal itself.</p>
<p>This group is for those seeking more information about healing using these innovative tools. Some of them can be used for self-healing, others are for working with a therapist or other health professional. My intention is to provide an overview of what's out there beyond the traditional tools of western psychology, open to anyone who's interested.</p>

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

I thought it only happened to people who were not educated or smart enough to know better or used drugs themselves. I was none of those things and it happened to me. Words do hurt. Drugs do kill. They killed who I was for 9 years even though I didn't not use them. <br>If you need a safe place to land and get the strength the grow without judgment this group is for you. The goal is support each other through sharing caring and empowerment. I want to help as many people as I can get rid of the shame that comes with an abusive relationship.

Improv For Life,"<p>Let's take Improv beyond Whose Line Is It Anyway and theatrical exercises.

Every interaction, in all of life, is a dance of Self and Other/s, where we want to balance bringing our Self fully to the communication while receiving the Other fully as well. The intention is to stay present, stay aware, and hit the sweet spot where giving and receiving blend together in a seamless flow. Let's practice that together!

<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

Let Go of Your Past and Make New Positive Friends,"<p>All of the meetups for this group will take place at the local Church of Scientology, where I am a volunteer. You can be of any religion to come. For example, I'm a Buddhist myself. You are not expected to change your religion here.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Have you been through stressful past situations, and you want to mentally move on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Are you interested in building new and strong relationships?</p>
<p>If you answered YES to both of these questions, you should join this group.</p>
<p>Having been a life improvement consultant at a non-profit organization for over 20 years, I know one of the reasons people cannot be positive is because they are tied down by their traumatic experiences.&nbsp; It's hard to be healthy mentally when you are reeling from your past upsets.&nbsp; Therefore, part of our activities in our meetups will be discussing ways to get over traumatic events, and, if you are willing, share some of your experiences with the other members.</p>
<p>Another reason people cannot move on is because they lack the relationship building or communication skills they need.&nbsp; For example, they may be introverted, uncomfortable talking with strangers, or do not seize opportunities to meaningfully connect with other people.&nbsp; Therefore, we will be discussing relationship building skills as well.</p>
<p>All of our meetup events will provide time for individual discussions, so members can share their deep thoughts and personal experiences.&nbsp; Typically, we'll have one meetup per week, and the first hour of the meetup will be a workshop to learn some tools for how to let go of the past and make new friends, and the second hour will be for individual discussions.&nbsp; All the meetup events for this group are free, and members are encouraged to bring friends. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested, join this group now. For any questions, please call Tony the Organizer at (916) 519-5287.</p>

Partners of Sexual Trauma Survivors,"<p>It can be heart wrenching to watch a loved one go through trauma. With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.</p> 
<p>This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other.</p>","[{u'name': u'Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'abusesurvivors', u'id': 2071}, {u'name': u'PTSD', u'urlkey': u'ptsd', u'id': 8117}, {u'name': u'Sexual Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'sexual-abuse-survivors', u'id': 15529}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Healing from Sexual Abuse', u'urlkey': u'healing-from-sexual-abuse', u'id': 23638}, {u'name': u'Grief Support for Partners and Spouses', u'urlkey': u'grief-support-for-partners-and-spouses', u'id': 24836}, {u'name': u'Trauma Survivors', u'urlkey': u'trauma-survivors', u'id': 28227}, {u'name': u'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', u'urlkey': u'post-traumatic-stress-disorder', u'id': 31451}, {u'name': u'How to deal with Grief', u'urlkey': u'how-to-deal-with-grief', u'id': 37860}, {u'name': u'Emotional Trauma and PTSD', u'urlkey': u'emotional-trauma-and-ptsd', u'id': 41952}, {u'name': u'PTSD Recovery', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-recovery', u'id': 88088}, {u'name': u'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse', u'urlkey': u'adult-survivors-of-child-abuse', u'id': 110960}, {u'name': u'Coping with Grief & Loss', u'urlkey': u'coping-with-grief-loss', u'id': 117127}, {u'name': u'PTSD Support Group', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-support-group', u'id': 128070}, {u'name': u'Trauma', u'urlkey': u'trauma', u'id': 433212}]"

With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.</p> 
<p>This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other.</p>","[{u'name': u'Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'abusesurvivors', u'id': 2071}, {u'name': u'PTSD', u'urlkey': u'ptsd', u'id': 8117}, {u'name': u'Sexual Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'sexual-abuse-survivors', u'id': 15529}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Healing from Sexual Abuse', u'urlkey': u'healing-from-sexual-abuse', u'id': 23638}, {u'name': u'Grief Support for Partners and Spouses', u'urlkey': u'grief-support-for-partners-and-spouses', u'id': 24836}, {u'name': u'Trauma Survivors', u'urlkey': u'trauma-survivors', u'id': 28227}, {u'name': u'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', u'urlkey': u'post-traumatic-stress-disorder', u'id': 31451}, {u'name': u'How to deal with Grief', u'urlkey': u'how-to-deal-with-grief', u'id': 37860}, {u'name': u'Emotional Trauma and PTSD', u'urlkey': u'emotional-trauma-and-ptsd', u'id': 41952}, {u'name': u'PTSD Recovery', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-recovery', u'id': 88088}, {u'name': u'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse', u'urlkey': u'adult-survivors-of-child-abuse', u'id': 110960}, {u'name': u'Coping with Grief & Loss', u'urlkey': u'coping-with-grief-loss', u'id': 117127}, {u'name': u'PTSD Support Group', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-support-group', u'id': 128070}, {u'name': u'Trauma', u'urlkey': u'trauma', u'id': 433212}]"
Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group. <br></p>
<p>If you'd like to personally find out how hypnotizable you are, take our quiz at: <br><a href=""http://berkeleyhypnosis.com/relieve-anxiety-quiz/"" class=""linkified"">http://berkeleyhypnosis.com/relieve-anxiety-quiz/</a></p>

San Jose Anxiety & Depression Social Support Group,"<p><span>We typically get together on Sunday afternoon about twice a month and chat at a park in San Jose and possible future events in the Fremont area as well. This is an informal group not facilitated by a Licensed mental health professional, just peer run. If this sounds like a meetup you would like to attend, please join.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>
<br>
<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

Partners of Sexual Trauma Survivors,"<p>It can be heart wrenching to watch a loved one go through trauma. With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.</p> 
<p>This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other.</p>","[{u'name': u'Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'abusesurvivors', u'id': 2071}, {u'name': u'PTSD', u'urlkey': u'ptsd', u'id': 8117}, {u'name': u'Sexual Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'sexual-abuse-survivors', u'id': 15529}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Healing from Sexual Abuse', u'urlkey': u'healing-from-sexual-abuse', u'id': 23638}, {u'name': u'Grief Support for Partners and Spouses', u'urlkey': u'grief-support-for-partners-and-spouses', u'id': 24836}, {u'name': u'Trauma Survivors', u'urlkey': u'trauma-survivors', u'id': 28227}, {u'name': u'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', u'urlkey': u'post-traumatic-stress-disorder', u'id': 31451}, {u'name': u'How to deal with Grief', u'urlkey': u'how-to-deal-with-grief', u'id': 37860}, {u'name': u'Emotional Trauma and PTSD', u'urlkey': u'emotional-trauma-and-ptsd', u'id': 41952}, {u'name': u'PTSD Recovery', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-recovery', u'id': 88088}, {u'name': u'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse', u'urlkey': u'adult-survivors-of-child-abuse', u'id': 110960}, {u'name': u'Coping with Grief & Loss', u'urlkey': u'coping-with-grief-loss', u'id': 117127}, {u'name': u'PTSD Support Group', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-support-group', u'id': 128070}, {u'name': u'Trauma', u'urlkey': u'trauma', u'id': 433212}]"

Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,"<p>Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. <br></p>
<p>Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because&nbsp; they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. <br></p>
<p>Please add yourself to our group. <br></p>

If you want to make a bad relationship into a good one, or a good relationship into a great one, this group is for you! It's sad, but true: love is not enough. Successful relationships also take skill. Skills like setting and enforcing boundaries, actively respecting yourself and others, knowing when and how to take care of yourself, being assertive--all play a part. I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist, and I realized I was teaching the same skills to all my clients. I created this class for my clients, their spouses, and others to accelerate their learning of crucial relationship skills at a low cost. Learn winning strategies and un-learn losing strategies in this eye-opening, interactive group. And if you're in therapy or working a 12-step program, this will definitely give your process a boost!

<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>
<br>
<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

Partners of Sexual Trauma Survivors,"<p>It can be heart wrenching to watch a loved one go through trauma. With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.</p> 
<p>This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other.</p>","[{u'name': u'Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'abusesurvivors', u'id': 2071}, {u'name': u'PTSD', u'urlkey': u'ptsd', u'id': 8117}, {u'name': u'Sexual Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'sexual-abuse-survivors', u'id': 15529}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Healing from Sexual Abuse', u'urlkey': u'healing-from-sexual-abuse', u'id': 23638}, {u'name': u'Grief Support for Partners and Spouses', u'urlkey': u'grief-support-for-partners-and-spouses', u'id': 24836}, {u'name': u'Trauma Survivors', u'urlkey': u'trauma-survivors', u'id': 28227}, {u'name': u'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', u'urlkey': u'post-traumatic-stress-disorder', u'id': 31451}, {u'name': u'How to deal with Grief', u'urlkey': u'how-to-deal-with-grief', u'id': 37860}, {u'name': u'Emotional Trauma and PTSD', u'urlkey': u'emotional-trauma-and-ptsd', u'id': 41952}, {u'name': u'PTSD Recovery', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-recovery', u'id': 88088}, {u'name': u'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse', u'urlkey': u'adult-survivors-of-child-abuse', u'id': 110960}, {u'name': u'Coping with Grief & Loss', u'urlkey': u'coping-with-grief-loss', u'id': 117127}, {u'name': u'PTSD Support Group', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-support-group', u'id': 128070}, {u'name': u'Trauma', u'urlkey': u'trauma', u'id': 433212}]"

Candor: High Control Group Recovery,"<p>We were born and raised in high control groups and, since leaving these groups, have struggled to understand the damage a movement revolving around a charismatic leader and/or elite few can do to the other members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our concerns lie with broken family connections, spiritual and physical abuse, financial abuse, insufficient education and the psychological problems stemming from all of these issues. While we understand that the ideologies of each unique group do have significant bearing on peoples' lives, our focus is to address the unhealthy manipulation experienced by members and not debate the ""rightness"" or ""wrongness"" of organizations' belief systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide a forum to share stories and ideas, empathize, learn, heal and connect to sources of aid. If you are tired of being ashamed of your former involvement (or are trying to leave) a high control group and would like to meet others who share the same experience, you have come to the right place. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
<p><span>Anyone who was born into or actively joined a movement -- regardless of size, faith, ideology or length of the group's existence -- and has experienced undue influence that altered their lives should consider joining. All ages and backgrounds are welcome.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our members are looking to understand both the positive and negative aspects of their experiences and are open to learning from others' stories. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Please join our group if you would like to share your story and/or simply listen and learn. It's cathartic to connect with others who understand and have overcome or are still struggling with similar situations.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Come to a monthly meet-up that begins with a presentation focusing on a differing theme with each meeting. &nbsp;Topics might include what constitutes a harmful group, specific struggles of people raised as children in high-control organizations (aka Second Generation Adults), gurus and Eastern-based organizations, shunning within groups, charismatic Christian groups, finding professional help, connecting with estranged family members and much more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The remainder of each meet up will be open to comment and discussion and end with the opportunity for members to better get to know each other.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>

You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.</p> 
<p>This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other.</p>","[{u'name': u'Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'abusesurvivors', u'id': 2071}, {u'name': u'PTSD', u'urlkey': u'ptsd', u'id': 8117}, {u'name': u'Sexual Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'sexual-abuse-survivors', u'id': 15529}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Healing from Sexual Abuse', u'urlkey': u'healing-from-sexual-abuse', u'id': 23638}, {u'name': u'Grief Support for Partners and Spouses', u'urlkey': u'grief-support-for-partners-and-spouses', u'id': 24836}, {u'name': u'Trauma Survivors', u'urlkey': u'trauma-survivors', u'id': 28227}, {u'name': u'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', u'urlkey': u'post-traumatic-stress-disorder', u'id': 31451}, {u'name': u'How to deal with Grief', u'urlkey': u'how-to-deal-with-grief', u'id': 37860}, {u'name': u'Emotional Trauma and PTSD', u'urlkey': u'emotional-trauma-and-ptsd', u'id': 41952}, {u'name': u'PTSD Recovery', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-recovery', u'id': 88088}, {u'name': u'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse', u'urlkey': u'adult-survivors-of-child-abuse', u'id': 110960}, {u'name': u'Coping with Grief & Loss', u'urlkey': u'coping-with-grief-loss', u'id': 117127}, {u'name': u'PTSD Support Group', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-support-group', u'id': 128070}, {u'name': u'Trauma', u'urlkey': u'trauma', u'id': 433212}]"

San Jose Anxiety & Depression Social Support Group,"<p><span>We typically get together on Sunday afternoon about twice a month and chat at a park in San Jose and possible future events in the Fremont area as well. This is an informal group not facilitated by a Licensed mental health professional, just peer run. If this sounds like a meetup you would like to attend, please join.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p>Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.</p>
<br>
<p>We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.</p>

Candor: High Control Group Recovery,"<p>We were born and raised in high control groups and, since leaving these groups, have struggled to understand the damage a movement revolving around a charismatic leader and/or elite few can do to the other members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our concerns lie with broken family connections, spiritual and physical abuse, financial abuse, insufficient education and the psychological problems stemming from all of these issues. While we understand that the ideologies of each unique group do have significant bearing on peoples' lives, our focus is to address the unhealthy manipulation experienced by members and not debate the ""rightness"" or ""wrongness"" of organizations' belief systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide a forum to share stories and ideas, empathize, learn, heal and connect to sources of aid. If you are tired of being ashamed of your former involvement (or are trying to leave) a high control group and would like to meet others who share the same experience, you have come to the right place. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
<p><span>Anyone who was born into or actively joined a movement -- regardless of size, faith, ideology or length of the group's existence -- and has experienced undue influence that altered their lives should consider joining. All ages and backgrounds are welcome.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our members are looking to understand both the positive and negative aspects of their experiences and are open to learning from others' stories. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Please join our group if you would like to share your story and/or simply listen and learn. It's cathartic to connect with others who understand and have overcome or are still struggling with similar situations.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><span>Come to a monthly meet-up that begins with a presentation focusing on a differing theme with each meeting. &nbsp;Topics might include what constitutes a harmful group, specific struggles of people raised as children in high-control organizations (aka Second Generation Adults), gurus and Eastern-based organizations, shunning within groups, charismatic Christian groups, finding professional help, connecting with estranged family members and much more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The remainder of each meet up will be open to comment and discussion and end with the opportunity for members to better get to know each other.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>

Partners of Sexual Trauma Survivors,"<p>It can be heart wrenching to watch a loved one go through trauma. With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.</p> 
<p>This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other.</p>","[{u'name': u'Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'abusesurvivors', u'id': 2071}, {u'name': u'PTSD', u'urlkey': u'ptsd', u'id': 8117}, {u'name': u'Sexual Abuse Survivors', u'urlkey': u'sexual-abuse-survivors', u'id': 15529}, {u'name': u'Support', u'urlkey': u'support', u'id': 19925}, {u'name': u'Healing from Sexual Abuse', u'urlkey': u'healing-from-sexual-abuse', u'id': 23638}, {u'name': u'Grief Support for Partners and Spouses', u'urlkey': u'grief-support-for-partners-and-spouses', u'id': 24836}, {u'name': u'Trauma Survivors', u'urlkey': u'trauma-survivors', u'id': 28227}, {u'name': u'Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', u'urlkey': u'post-traumatic-stress-disorder', u'id': 31451}, {u'name': u'How to deal with Grief', u'urlkey': u'how-to-deal-with-grief', u'id': 37860}, {u'name': u'Emotional Trauma and PTSD', u'urlkey': u'emotional-trauma-and-ptsd', u'id': 41952}, {u'name': u'PTSD Recovery', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-recovery', u'id': 88088}, {u'name': u'Adult Survivors of Child Abuse', u'urlkey': u'adult-survivors-of-child-abuse', u'id': 110960}, {u'name': u'Coping with Grief & Loss', u'urlkey': u'coping-with-grief-loss', u'id': 117127}, {u'name': u'PTSD Support Group', u'urlkey': u'ptsd-support-group', u'id': 128070}, {u'name': u'Trauma', u'urlkey': u'trauma', u'id': 433212}]"

Living Positive with Chronic Disease,"<p><span>Congratulations on finding us. The last thing you needed, on top of chronic illness, is the frustration of finding help. Hopefully this group will help.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn't start this group and it's not mine. It's ours. Just like the dreaded pirate Roberts in Princess Bride, it was passed on to me after it was passed on to them. Thanks to those before me. I hope I continue the group as it was intended.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are my proposed goals for the group:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Equal time for equal pain. No one likes to talk more than I do, but equal time should be had by all. Wait, I'm not finished yet.</span></p>
<p><span>2. We laugh, we cry, even if you're a guy. Rhyming is not required.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Accommodate the accommodations. Sit, stand, or lay. Light, sound, and smells can all be adjusted to fit your needs. Please: shower-yes, perfume-no. Make-up is optional, clothing is not.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Too late, too early, wrong day, right place. We adjust as needed to be accessible to those interested in attending. If you don't have a horse in the race you can't complain about the track.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Nothing leaves the room. Well, we do, but what we say doesn't. Well, I guess it does, in our heads. It just should stay there. Unless we forget it, which is also ok.</span></p>
<p><span>6. All other guidelines to be determined. And determined we will be.

Instead of a non-profit, lets self-organize and self-pay for a outdoor adventure in stunning locations with private guides, and customize the trip so that we can work on our businesses as needed. We will be understanding of each person's physical limitations and ensure everyone has a safe and fun time.

Young Entrepreneurs Fighting Cancer Through Adventure,"<p>This is a global support group for young entrepreneurs/CEOs who have had cancer or is currently fighting cancer and want to connect to others that share their background. As a fellow entrepreneur and cancer survivor, I want to reach out to others like myself so that we can fight cancer through adventure and nature. While there are non-profits (such as <a href=""https://firstdescents.org/"" class=""linkified"">https://firstdescents.org/</a>) that has a similar mission, there does not exist a organization that is designed for entrepreneurs/CEOs. Instead of a non-profit, lets self-organize and self-pay for a outdoor adventure in stunning locations with private guides, and customize the trip so that we can work on our businesses as needed. We will be understanding of each person's physical limitations and ensure everyone has a safe and fun time.

Komen 3-Day Walkers - Hands Up For Hooters,"<p>We are Hands Up For Hooters, the 3rd largest team in the US walking and fundraising for the Susan G. Komen 3-Day event, based right here in Sacramento/Fair Oaks.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Over the next year, we will train to be able to walk 20 miles a day (we're not kidding) for 3 days in a row in the Komen 3-Day in San Diego this coming November. Don't worry, you really CAN do it. We start at 3 miles each day and work up. You will get in shape, you'll meet new positive friends with an ""I can do it"" attitude, and you will have a group to safely walk with every Sunday morning, while focusing on creating a world without death from breast cancer. We start increasing our miles in May, but til then, we walk only 3 miles every Sunday at 8am. We meet in the heart of Fair Oaks Village, across from the Fair Oaks Coffee and Deli (10223 Fair Oaks Blvd). You'll see us standing on the corner. Our name is Hands Up For Hooters and you can read about us (or join our team) at <a>www.HandsUpForHooters.com.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You are welcome to come walk with us on Sunday mornings, and hear about our team and our fundraising success.&nbsp; Over the last 3 years our team has raised over $530,000 for Komen, to help bring an end to death from breast cancer.</p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Walking', u'urlkey': u'walkers', u'id': 933}, {u'name': u'Breast Cancer Survivors', u'urlkey': u'bcs', u'id': 1275}, {u'name': u'Outdoor  Fitness', u'urlkey': u'outdoor-fitness', u'id': 15672}, {u'name': u'Walking For Weight Loss', u'urlkey': u'walking-for-health-and-weight-loss', u'id': 15835}, {u'name': u'Walking for Fitness', u'urlkey': u'walking-for-fitness', u'id': 15893}, {u'name': u'Exercise', u'urlkey': u'excercise', u'id': 25375}, {u'name': u'Breast Cancer Survivors: Networking', u'urlkey': u'breast-cancer-survivors-networking', u'id': 51780}, {u'name': u'Breast Cancer', u'urlkey': u'breast-cancer', u'id': 55479}, {u'name': u'Exercise and Fitness', u'urlkey': u'exercise-and-fitness', u'id': 58155}, {u'name': u'Walking for health', u'urlkey': u'walking-for-health', u'id': 142171}]"

Komen 3-Day Walkers - Hands Up For Hooters,"<p>We are Hands Up For Hooters, the 3rd largest team in the US walking and fundraising for the Susan G. Komen 3-Day event, based right here in Sacramento/Fair Oaks.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Over the next year, we will train to be able to walk 20 miles a day (we're not kidding) for 3 days in a row in the Komen 3-Day in San Diego this coming November. Don't worry, you really CAN do it. We start at 3 miles each day and work up. You will get in shape, you'll meet new positive friends with an ""I can do it"" attitude, and you will have a group to safely walk with every Sunday morning, while focusing on creating a world without death from breast cancer. We start increasing our miles in May, but til then, we walk only 3 miles every Sunday at 8am. We meet in the heart of Fair Oaks Village, across from the Fair Oaks Coffee and Deli (10223 Fair Oaks Blvd). You'll see us standing on the corner. Our name is Hands Up For Hooters and you can read about us (or join our team) at <a>www.HandsUpForHooters.com.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You are welcome to come walk with us on Sunday mornings, and hear about our team and our fundraising success.&nbsp; Over the last 3 years our team has raised over $530,000 for Komen, to help bring an end to death from breast cancer.</p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Walking', u'urlkey': u'walkers', u'id': 933}, {u'name': u'Breast Cancer Survivors', u'urlkey': u'bcs', u'id': 1275}, {u'name': u'Outdoor  Fitness', u'urlkey': u'outdoor-fitness', u'id': 15672}, {u'name': u'Walking For Weight Loss', u'urlkey': u'walking-for-health-and-weight-loss', u'id': 15835}, {u'name': u'Walking for Fitness', u'urlkey': u'walking-for-fitness', u'id': 15893}, {u'name': u'Exercise', u'urlkey': u'excercise', u'id': 25375}, {u'name': u'Breast Cancer Survivors: Networking', u'urlkey': u'breast-cancer-survivors-networking', u'id': 51780}, {u'name': u'Breast Cancer', u'urlkey': u'breast-cancer', u'id': 55479}, {u'name': u'Exercise and Fitness', u'urlkey': u'exercise-and-fitness', u'id': 58155}, {u'name': u'Walking for health', u'urlkey': u'walking-for-health', u'id': 142171}]"
