Decriminalize Prostitution!,"<p>We're a group of sex workers, clients, taxpayers, freedom lovers, and people from all walks of life working together to stop the immoral, wasteful, and futile practice of arresting and prosecuting consensual sexual acts. Thank you to everyone who helped work to pass Proposition K on the November 2008 ballot here in San Francisco to decriminalize prostitution! While we were unsuccessful this time, we did receive over 41% of the vote, and served notice once again that our movement is not going away. Next time, Liberty willing, we will win! In the meantime, the ongoing work of organizing the sex work community and supporting each other when we are targeted by government or public intolerance, bigotry, or greed for our justly acquired earnings continues... If you are new to this movement, some helpful additional information and resources can be found on the websites of the Prostitutes Education Network (http://www.bayswan.org/), the Sex Workers Outreach Project (http://www.swop-usa.org), Erotic Service Providers Union (http://www.espu-ca.org), and Californians for Privacy (http://www.californians4privacy.us/).

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

Peninsula Feminist Book Club,"<p>Hello Feminists,</p>
<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>

Reformers for a New America,"<p><b><i>Our troubled age, and our mission -</i></b></p>
<p>In 21st century America, our most vital institutions - healthcare, education, government, the military, the media, the courts, and so forth - &nbsp;have been overtaken by a small group of financial elites, who have so entrenched and solidified their power through the accumulation of wealth, via the mechanisms of capitalism, that change has become all but impossible to enact within our current captive federal and local governments. In prolonged, unwinnable wars benefiting only defense contractors, environmental policy allowing for the oil industry's continued rape of the earth and contribution to ever-worsening climate change, crumbling infrastructure, and profit motivated deregulation resulting in, for one, the exposure of children to lead in their drinking water, the consequences of this seizure of power have infected, and are continuing to poison, day by day, the health of our citizenry.</p>
<p>While such corruption plays out, negatively effecting all in our nation but the few who are responsible for it, we as Americans remain divided over issues such as political affiliation and race. We forget in the midst of our fighting that our two political tribes, Democrat and Republican, are equally inept to meet our needs as individuals as long as they remain in the pockets of the wealthy, and special interests. And while the racism we see today cannot be said to be the result of class alone, having its roots as well in historical oppression, it has been inflamed severely by the marginalization and humiliation of impoverished peoples of all colors due to the widening wealth gap.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is thus to unite all - black, white, brown, people of every color, background, and creed - under the goal of reforming our nation so as to allow each and every individual equal opportunity to flourish, and to live free from poverty and the worry of poverty, on a clean, healthy planet. In so doing we seek to finally live up to the proclamation of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and to thus make our nation into what it should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Our means of systematic change will be massive nonviolent, non-cooperation with our current government, such that not a drop of blood will need to be shed for the purposes of taking back our power. All that will be needed will be a collective decision from the mass of citizenry, including law enforcement and military, that enough is enough, and we will not be challenged by the minority who are left to oppose us. It will then be left for us as citizenry to convene a new Continental Congress, as our founders once did, where we will debate and discuss, as they once did, the new, better nation that we wish to build out of the ashes of the old.</p>

"Civil Rights History Discussion Group, SF","<p>In this group we'll dive deep into the many dimensions of the struggle for racial justice in twentieth-century America, and we'll have a helluva lot of fun while we do it! Over drinks, each month we'll discuss something fascinating from the spectrum of racial justice history - armed resistance; nonviolence; profound strategy; successes and failures; deep context; multiracial alliance building; nefarious tactics of divisiveness; histories of whiteness and structural and strategic racism; radical women and powerful youth; the profound legacy of LGBT figures in black and brown freedom struggles; grassroots mobilizations... This will be all about learning deeply about important issues, while having excellent conversations and building community. <br></p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Structure</p>
<p>- This will be about everyone's voice being present, as long as they wish it to be... about everyone being able to express their ideas, ask their questions, be fully heard, and engage in meaningful dialog. There will be a facilitator, but we should practice the good ol' step up/step back. <br></p>
<p>- The readings each month will be somewhere between 10 to 20 pages; so it will be very accessible to folks with busy lives.&nbsp; However, it will be deep.&nbsp; Please read the material if you plan on attending.&nbsp; If you start but don't quite make it through, no worries, please come! <br></p>
<p>- As you read, think of these three things: What parts of the story most interest you? Is there anything you feel confusion about or want more clarity around? Are their connections you can draw between the story and the present moment? Considering these three things as you read will ensure especially awesome conversations! <br></p>
<p>- If the struggle for racial justice is something you have deep knowledge about and feel absolutely comfortable talking about, bring your wisdom! If this subject is new to you and it feels super heavy and you feel a little uneasy talking about it but you know its important and you want to figure it out, this is the perfect place for you too!&nbsp; We'll help you build up your knowledge and develop your voice, and we'll have fun.&nbsp; Let's make this a space for helping one another along the path; wherever we are on the path. <br></p>

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

I saw Zeitgeist Moving Forward a year ago and in that finally found something that&nbsp;illustrated so masterfually&nbsp;everything I had always thought, the documentary was mind blowing and life changing. Thank you Netflix for adding this to your library for the public to see!</p>
<p>&nbsp;There seems to be no real forums to actually talk to other like minded people even online, which is frustrating. Most of us know the masses are not open minded enough to even realize why they have the beliefs they have. so really I&nbsp;&nbsp;can count&nbsp;on my hand the number of people I know&nbsp;who have agree with a resource based economy, I find it harder and harder to relate to the indoctrinated masses.</p>
<p>So it would be really nice to see if we can get some people to join, and who are up for chatting. &nbsp; And hopefully get to a point to where we can have some regular in person meetups.... And maybe attend next year's Z-Day. </p>
<p>Would love for you to join, and open to any and all suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.</p>

Through our practice of Nichiren Buddhism, we awaken to the dignity and power that reside WITHIN us and TRANSFORM ourselves on the DEEPEST level. We are the Soka Gakkai (value creation) lay organization who chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, we reveal our inherent Buddha nature which permeates all aspects of our lives, environment and the entire universe. As a result, we experience positive changes and undergo a PROFOUND process of SELF-TRANSFORMATION called Human Revolution, which becomes the FOUNDATION for lasting happiness and we want to SHARE with OTHERS.. SGI President Ikeda says ""A great human revolution in JUST a SINGLE individual will help achieve a CHANGE in the destiny of a NATION and further, will enable a CHANGE in the DESTINY of ALL Humankind. If you want to find out how YOU can make a difference, please join us in dialogue and an Introduction to Buddhism for Peace Meet Up.</p>"

RTS Sexual Violence Prevention and Survivor Support,"<p>Rape Trauma Services of San Mateo County strives to eliminate all forms of violence, with a special focus on sexual assault and abuse. Informed by our understanding of traumatic experiences and cycles of violence, we facilitate healing and the prevention of violence through the provision of counseling, advocacy, and education.

<p>We invite anyone in the community interested in learning, sharing and/or taking an active role in preventing sexual violence and supporting people who have been affected by sexual violence to join our group.</p>"
Volunteer Queer!,"<p>A meetup for queer folks and allies who want to volunteer with LGBTQ+ nonprofits! Meet new people and work with the organizations and activists that support our community every day. We'll meet up for volunteer activities once a month (or more, as needed!), and hang out after!</p>"
Peninsula Feminist Book Club,"<p>Hello Feminists,</p>
<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>
<p> <br></p>"
Safe Places - Social Activism,"<p>Are you a protective person? Do you believe in the the Dream of Martin Luther King Jr?

Do you want your children growing up in a country where they are free to think and express their opinions without fear of violent repercussions? Let's meet up to discuss nonviolent political activism, brainstorm together about what we can do to turn the tide here in the Bay Area, and get out there and DO something!</p>"
Trees for Oakland,"<p>We plant trees in Oakland where people ask us to -- along streets, at parks, at schools, and more -- especially in the parts of town that need trees the most. Join us if you want to use your muscles and your mind to help make Oakland a (literally) greener place.

<p>We wonder why there's so much work to be done to help the masses while most capital goes towards consolidating capital further. We battle mental illness, feelings of alienation, underemployment, and hopelessness, but have a sneaking feeling that we aren't really the problem. We've had ""good jobs"" but can't seem to shake the feeling of being ground down. We're ready for a different way. &lt;br&gt;</p>"

Bay Area Women of Color Hiking Group,"<p>This a group for WOC (Women of Color) hikers in the Bay Area. This includes cis, gay, straight, non-binary and trans women, and anyone who identifies as a women of color.</p>
<p>I started this group to meet other outdoorsy women of color who like to hike! Being an avid hiker and backpacker, I have often found that POCs (and especially WOC) aren't well-represented in the outdoors, and I'd like to do what I can to change that by giving WOC a safe space to hike and experience the outdoors.</p>
<p>If you also like happy hours and brunch, and discussing current events/social justice (and maybe even discussing current events/social justice over happy hour or brunch), we'll probably do some of that too!</p>

SoOakland Collective,"<p>Hello, I am Shayla Jamerson. Founder of SoOakland. A organization I started 2 years ago to change the perspective of how Black Oakland was viewed. I created events that are safe spaces for the Black and Brown community as well as the natives. As a native of Oakland its disheartening what is happening int he city as far as gentrification is concerned.

"Civil Rights History Discussion Group, SF","<p>In this group we'll dive deep into the many dimensions of the struggle for racial justice in twentieth-century America, and we'll have a helluva lot of fun while we do it! Over drinks, each month we'll discuss something fascinating from the spectrum of racial justice history - armed resistance; nonviolence; profound strategy; successes and failures; deep context; multiracial alliance building; nefarious tactics of divisiveness; histories of whiteness and structural and strategic racism; radical women and powerful youth; the profound legacy of LGBT figures in black and brown freedom struggles; grassroots mobilizations... This will be all about learning deeply about important issues, while having excellent conversations and building community. <br></p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Structure</p>
<p>- This will be about everyone's voice being present, as long as they wish it to be... about everyone being able to express their ideas, ask their questions, be fully heard, and engage in meaningful dialog. There will be a facilitator, but we should practice the good ol' step up/step back. <br></p>
<p>- The readings each month will be somewhere between 10 to 20 pages; so it will be very accessible to folks with busy lives.&nbsp; However, it will be deep.&nbsp; Please read the material if you plan on attending.&nbsp; If you start but don't quite make it through, no worries, please come! <br></p>
<p>- As you read, think of these three things: What parts of the story most interest you? Is there anything you feel confusion about or want more clarity around? Are their connections you can draw between the story and the present moment? Considering these three things as you read will ensure especially awesome conversations! <br></p>
<p>- If the struggle for racial justice is something you have deep knowledge about and feel absolutely comfortable talking about, bring your wisdom! If this subject is new to you and it feels super heavy and you feel a little uneasy talking about it but you know its important and you want to figure it out, this is the perfect place for you too!&nbsp; We'll help you build up your knowledge and develop your voice, and we'll have fun.&nbsp; Let's make this a space for helping one another along the path; wherever we are on the path. <br></p>

<p>Odd surprise is that they are struggling badly because of absence of system in place to help local people from here to make better choices in education and career.</p>
<p>United states have been the birth place ( incubator ) of latest technological innovations; information technology; and many inventions. <br>To continue its leading position, however it is dependent on human talent from outside countries. <br>The paradox is that this heavy dependence exists at the same time when there are many many local Americans ( youngsters &amp; mature individuals) <br>who are deserving but are not fully informed / Aware <br>who are bright but are directionless <br>in making right choices for education and career. What we will do : <br>We will guide them to take better decisions in education and professional life. More importantly, we are also goingt to network with large corporates and research organistions to create some special opportunities for our members and overall local americans.

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

We will explore these issues from a variety of perspectives, acknowledging that that they impact women of different racial identities, classes, and sexual identities in different ways. We also acknowledge that different groups of women have vastly different histories of experiencing reproductive oppression.</p>"

Adventures in History and Culture,"<p>Welcome history and culture enthusiasts! Let's go explore the Bay Area's cultural treasures around us! We visit archaeological sites, museum exhibits, participate in discussions, go to historical reenactments, attend plays and operas, explore old parts of cities, visit fairs and festivals, learn skills at workshops, go on tours, enjoy movies, and more!&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Everyone is welcome</strong>: families with kids, students, scholars, seniors, singles, LGBTQ, all ethnicities, people with all ranges of physical capabilities, all religious backgrounds, and those ranging from the aspiring Indiana Jones to people just rekindling their interest in history and culture. &nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>In addition to exploring new places each month, we also have our own bookclub: </strong><i>(we currently need a new host for this, so please let me know if you'd be interested!)</i></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>Meeting every 6-8 weeks, we choose our own book from any genre that is related to that meeting's topic. &nbsp;For example, one topic we had was the US Civil War, where people chose books covering culturally-based war tactics, Lincoln's funeral train, articles from that time, and fiction. &nbsp;By having a topic that we base a variety of books choices on, we are able to have a more holistic discussion from interdisciplinary perspectives. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p>We start out by everyone introducing themselves and their book with a brief description of what it was about, an interesting fact, and how they felt about it (30 seconds to two minutes each). &nbsp;Then we open up to a naturally flowing discussion. &nbsp;It is okay to also just sit and listen the whole time!</p> 
 <p>""Book"" is used loosely to describe a possibility of many medias: songs, films, scripts, anthologies, short stories, newspaper and journal articles, magazines, and art.</p>
 <p><b>Our monthly Cuisine and Convo event:</b></p>
 <p>Each month, we choose a cultural place in the world (i.e. not strictly geographical) and then find a group-friendly, highly-rated restaurant featuring traditional foods from that country. Similar to the book club, we chat about that culture in an interdisciplinary manner drawing from our own experiences of travel, books or movies, college classes, crafts, scanning trivia online, to...well, anything at all as long as it relates.</p>
 <p>You can bring books, pictures, artifacts, or just yourself. &nbsp;If you don't get a chance to look up something about that culture, you can always bring up a ""top 10"" trivia on your phone about the culture/location. &nbsp;After we finish our brief show-and-tell/sharing, we open up to casual conversation about the culture or whatever topic morphs from that.</p>
 <p>Occasionally we will host this with a concurrent cultural festival like combining the topic of Germany with an Oktoberfest celebration or Greece with a trip to the Greek Festival.</p>
 <p>Please bring cash in case we can't split the check. &nbsp;You only pay for what you ordered, but tax and tip will be divided evenly by the number of people present regardless of what you ordered.</p>

20 somethings Tri Valley Arts & Community,"<p>As a young adult in the age of social media it can often be hard to meet people willing to try new, adventurous things TOGETHER. I see many people socialize but often just in the environment of a house party or a happy hour, not over a shared interest or unique hobby. I'm hoping to rekindle the spirit of community and encourage people to step outside their social comfort zone by meeting new people who value the beauty of community building and the serendipity of new friendships. We can do this by trying new coffee shops around the Bay Area, attending open mic nights, starting a book club, going to poetry readings, going to painting classes, etc. I've noticed that technology and my professional demands often take up so much of my emotional energy that I'm spending more time texting or face timing friends than seeing them in a routine, face to face, healthy way. If you feel/have ever felt this way just know you're not alone and that hopefully this group will be a good place to change that. And the perfect start to find interesting, smart new people in your community!</p>"

Sacramento Politics and Philosophy Group,"<p>This is a group for those in the Sacramento area who like to discuss politics and philosophy. We have all had different experiences in life, but we always find that political issues are very relevant to our lives and we want to discuss these issues with others. These days, political discussions are sometimes constructive, but unfortunately they often become hostile when people with differing views are in the same room. It is important for us all to hear views other than our own from time to time, and there has to be a way to have honest, thoughtful discussions on issues important to our lives while keeping the discussion calm and polite. In this discussion group, we try to avoid being overly biased when presenting opinions and we will also work to avoid use of fallacies in making points. We expect that there will be differences of opinion, but as long as we keep a philosophical mindset these discussions should not descend into hostility. Many of us also like to discuss philosophical topics and we will have time for this as well and we will probably find that most philosophical concepts have real-world applications, including political. So this discussion group will hover between these two subjects, and we might even at times focus on other subjects as well.</p>"

We'll primarily be reading books with social justice themes, or books by authors who often get left out of mainstream book clubs.

<p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.</p>

<p><i><b>Thank you for contacting the Berkeley Cannabis Action Group. We initiated and formed from the interest of 2 current Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commissioners and several local cannabis cultivators and business operators. Specifically, we are currently primarily interested in spurring a recalcitrant Berkeley Mayor and City Council to act this fall in approving a cultivation ordinance and a cultivation licensing process in the city of Berkeley.&nbsp;</b></i></p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>FYI, the Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commission sent their recommended cultivation ordinance to the Mayor and BCC for review, approval and passage in March of 2015. Excuses given for the delay have been the lack of state legislation, which was indeed signed by Governor Brown in Oct. 2015!&nbsp;</b></i></p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>Regarding the cultivation licensing process, the cannabis commission cultivation subcommittee will meet Monday Aug. 22, 3:30 pm, Berkeley Planning Center, at the corner of Milvia and Center. We hope then to finalize and recommend a process to the full medical cannabis commission for approval at their Sept. 8 meeting. With commission approval, the cultivation licensing process will be sent to the Mayor and BCC for their review and passage.&nbsp;</b></i></p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>Upon medical cannabis commission cultivation licensing process recommendation, our Action Group then will meet to discuss possible strategy and tactics to persuade the Mayor and City Council to act in accordance with other jurisdictions (SF, Oakland, Richmond, Santa Cruz), who have all passed cultivation ordinances and licensing. Incidentally, we'll be reviewing the cultivation regulations of the fore-mentioned cities at the Aug. 22, cultivation subcommittee meeting.</b></i></p> 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>In the future and down the road, our Action Group will also lobby the Mayor and City Council regarding cannabis issues such as, delivery services, nurseries, state regulation and legalization.

Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,"<p>Saving&nbsp;sharks for&nbsp;ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Sharks are symbols of ocean health.&nbsp;Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean.&nbsp;Until Now.</p>
<p>Today many species are threatened and could go&nbsp;extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.</p>Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.
<p><a href=""http://sharktober.com/sharkstewards/category/campaigns/"">Our campaigns</a>, e.g. the Healthy Oceans Initiative and Golden Gate Marine Protected Area Collaborative&nbsp;are directed towards raising awareness of shark conservation, sustainable fisheries, improved water quality and marine ecosystem protection. We advocate policy including the banning of shark finning, and regulating the shark fin trade in the USA and the Pacific Rim</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Join Shark Stewards and LUSH Cosmetics in a public shout out for sharks on Saturday 10/22 at the LUSH store at Mandalay Bay. Wear your shark suit and bring your mermaids and little fish and attend this publicity event to support the Federal Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act.

DogPAC,"<p><b>DogPAC of SF</b>&nbsp;is a registered political action committee that focuses on the health and welfare of animals but primarily issues relating to dogs in the City &amp; County of San Francisco and beyond.</p>
<p>Dog advocates are as diverse as the breeds and mutts they care for. But when it comes to caring for animals there is a passionate bond that unites people in a common movement to improve the quality of life with pets. The committee has been recognized as a vanguard in bringing about policies that benefit the larger pet population and the people who care for them.</p>
<p><b>DogPAC of SF</b>&nbsp;advocates for the most pressing animal welfare issues that include greater access to housing for people with pets, shared use of parks and open space, and adequate City and County services to protect and treat animal populations. We have strong partnerships with animal shelters and rescues and with many organizations and community leaders who share a vision for animal welfare and responsible pet guardianship.</p>
<p>Considered one of the most pet-friendly cities, San Francisco alone has more than 150,000 dogs that are household members or waiting for an adoptive family. The entire SF Bay Area including visitor with their dogs far exceeds this many which warrants flexible policies to accommodate all.</p>
<p><i>Meetup at our events and help shape how recreation with our dogs needs to be!</i></p>

<p>We have a new Initiative ""California calls for Constitutional Convention"" - and a corresponding fundraising campaign that is LIVE now!

Order Out of Chaos - The Great Transition,"<p>This is a San Francisco meetup for those who realize that civilization as it goes is heading lemming-like for the cliff. We will discuss how we might team up at the global level with the millions of like minded folk who are looking for a solution. We will decide what can we do locally together. Our sponsoring organization is Collective Communication, Inc and its Voices of Humanity - Order Out of Chaos online project: <a href=""http://voh.intermix.org"" class=""linkified"">http://voh.intermix.org</a>. Voices of Humanity &lt;-- In the conversation between the communities of Planet Earth, women and men will use their collective voices to persuade the nations to cooperate. A kindly and intelligent human unity with diversity built-in is ours for the taking!!! Your participation could make the difference. Let's use our show-business ingenuity to make it happen!</p>
<p>But maybe you have another idea - you are welcome!</p>"
Code For Democracy SF,"<p>Who should join: You should join if the recent political climate has created in you a desire to ""do something"" and if you feel that a good way for you to do something will involve leveraging technology. The original Code For Democracy NYC group was founded on Jan 20th 2017, and is growing quickly. I hope and expect that we can develop a great group in SF to leverage tech for democracy, equality, and fact-based policy.</p> 
<p>What will we do: We are brand new, so I expect that the first meetup will center around 2 goals: 1. We will brainstorm ways that we can work together to make a difference, locally or at a national level. This can be through webapps, phone apps, novel dissemination of information, donating tech services, etc. 2. We will form groups around projects of merit discussed in step 2 and get to work.</p> 
<p>What we are NOT: 1. We are not a debate group. Of course, alignment on issues within the scope of each project will be important for efficacy and unity, but many of us spend many hours learning, debating, and evangelizing already; this group is for taking action. 2. We are not exclusive: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend and will be treated with respect.</p>"

Indivisible Resistors - Silicon Valley,"<p>We're young, old, straight, queer, white, not-white... just folk resisting Trump. <br> <br>Our starting point is ""The Indivisibility Guide"" (<a href=""https://www.indivisibleguide.com/guide/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.indivisibleguide.com/guide/</a>). &nbsp;Repeatedly contacting Congress is our core mission - by phone, by fax, by creative means. We &lt;3 town halls. <br> <br>Some of us also enjoy marches, many are dancers, and all of us like laughing, so we may have a flash mob in the dry season.</p>
<p>Commitment level varies widely and that is aok. <br> <br>We meet twice a month, reviewing, planning, connecting. <br> <br>Meetings are 7PM on 1st and 3rd Wednesdays. Current location is 6148 Bollinger Ave, San Jose. That's far far west San Jose - Cupertino in all but name. <br> <br>We're fortunate to have professional project management coordinating/facilitating.</p>
<p>Home base for us is Facebook at&nbsp;<a href=""http://fb.me/IndivisibleResistorsSV"">fb.me/IndivisibleResistorsSV</a>&nbsp; <br> <br> <br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/South-Bay-Rapid-Response-Indivisible-358712034498878/"" class=""linkified""></a></p>"
Monday Night Mission: East Oakland,"<p>We are a group of friends trying to share love and care with the less fortunate. At the moment we are focused on food giveaways for the homeless or anyone hungry which we do once a week on Mondays. We get together around 6 PM, make sandwiches for about an hour. We then take the foods to an impoverished area near International St and 82 (near Walgreens; few blocks south of Hegenberger Rd). We travel up and down the street, giving away sandwiches, bananas, brownies, water, and anything else we may have. We strive to be friendly, respectful, unassuming, helpful and caring with everyone we meet. We strive to be organized and careful as we travel this area. We are usually done in with the giveaways in about an hour. Optional but encouraged is then to regroup to share our experiences and suggestions with each other.</p>
<p>There is no bureaucracy, no fund, no membership and no requirements to show up. We welcome people of all faiths and beliefs. Any food you may choose to bring goes directly to people in the streets. Foods that are easily packaged and distributed are best but please don't bring foods associated with strong negative effects on health (sodas, high fructose corn syrup, etc.) or anything you wouldn't eat yourself. Donations of bread, peanut butter, jelly/jam, cheeses, meats, sandwich bags, food handling gloves, bananas, apples, water, brownies, cookies always work.</p>

Finding Love & Resilency -Thriving in the Face of Conflict,<p>How to thrive in this political climate. <br>You may be wondering how to overcome negative thoughts swirling around regarding the political arena. This group focuses on empowering each person to celebrate and find your unique voice and creative stance during this next six months. Once a month. <br>$18-20 dollar donation.</p>
Folsom Corporatists,"<p>This meetup is for people who think that white civil rights are under attack, but don't believe that racism is the answer. Here we can meet and discuss the nature of ethnic corporatism in America, and how it might be made into a more positive force in society. As corporatists, we reject supremacy in all forms, e.g. race, class, religion, ideology, etc. Tyranny of the minority and tyranny of the majority are both tyrannies.</p>
<p>Sweden, Denmark and Germany are corporatist states. They apply corporatism to labor/business relations; Sweden in particular is known for a high degree of collaboration between capital and labor, to (great) mutual benefit, unlike the U.S.'s adversarial model.

<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>

When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only.

Reformers for a New America,"<p><b><i>Our troubled age, and our mission -</i></b></p>
<p>In 21st century America, our most vital institutions - healthcare, education, government, the military, the media, the courts, and so forth - &nbsp;have been overtaken by a small group of financial elites, who have so entrenched and solidified their power through the accumulation of wealth, via the mechanisms of capitalism, that change has become all but impossible to enact within our current captive federal and local governments. In prolonged, unwinnable wars benefiting only defense contractors, environmental policy allowing for the oil industry's continued rape of the earth and contribution to ever-worsening climate change, crumbling infrastructure, and profit motivated deregulation resulting in, for one, the exposure of children to lead in their drinking water, the consequences of this seizure of power have infected, and are continuing to poison, day by day, the health of our citizenry.</p>
<p>While such corruption plays out, negatively effecting all in our nation but the few who are responsible for it, we as Americans remain divided over issues such as political affiliation and race. We forget in the midst of our fighting that our two political tribes, Democrat and Republican, are equally inept to meet our needs as individuals as long as they remain in the pockets of the wealthy, and special interests. And while the racism we see today cannot be said to be the result of class alone, having its roots as well in historical oppression, it has been inflamed severely by the marginalization and humiliation of impoverished peoples of all colors due to the widening wealth gap.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is thus to unite all - black, white, brown, people of every color, background, and creed - under the goal of reforming our nation so as to allow each and every individual equal opportunity to flourish, and to live free from poverty and the worry of poverty, on a clean, healthy planet. In so doing we seek to finally live up to the proclamation of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and to thus make our nation into what it should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Our means of systematic change will be massive nonviolent, non-cooperation with our current government, such that not a drop of blood will need to be shed for the purposes of taking back our power. All that will be needed will be a collective decision from the mass of citizenry, including law enforcement and military, that enough is enough, and we will not be challenged by the minority who are left to oppose us. It will then be left for us as citizenry to convene a new Continental Congress, as our founders once did, where we will debate and discuss, as they once did, the new, better nation that we wish to build out of the ashes of the old.</p>

"Civil Rights History Discussion Group, SF","<p>In this group we'll dive deep into the many dimensions of the struggle for racial justice in twentieth-century America, and we'll have a helluva lot of fun while we do it! Over drinks, each month we'll discuss something fascinating from the spectrum of racial justice history - armed resistance; nonviolence; profound strategy; successes and failures; deep context; multiracial alliance building; nefarious tactics of divisiveness; histories of whiteness and structural and strategic racism; radical women and powerful youth; the profound legacy of LGBT figures in black and brown freedom struggles; grassroots mobilizations... This will be all about learning deeply about important issues, while having excellent conversations and building community. <br></p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Structure</p>
<p>- This will be about everyone's voice being present, as long as they wish it to be... about everyone being able to express their ideas, ask their questions, be fully heard, and engage in meaningful dialog. There will be a facilitator, but we should practice the good ol' step up/step back. <br></p>
<p>- The readings each month will be somewhere between 10 to 20 pages; so it will be very accessible to folks with busy lives.&nbsp; However, it will be deep.&nbsp; Please read the material if you plan on attending.&nbsp; If you start but don't quite make it through, no worries, please come! <br></p>
<p>- As you read, think of these three things: What parts of the story most interest you? Is there anything you feel confusion about or want more clarity around? Are their connections you can draw between the story and the present moment? Considering these three things as you read will ensure especially awesome conversations! <br></p>
<p>- If the struggle for racial justice is something you have deep knowledge about and feel absolutely comfortable talking about, bring your wisdom! If this subject is new to you and it feels super heavy and you feel a little uneasy talking about it but you know its important and you want to figure it out, this is the perfect place for you too!&nbsp; We'll help you build up your knowledge and develop your voice, and we'll have fun.&nbsp; Let's make this a space for helping one another along the path; wherever we are on the path. <br></p>

<p>We meet in cafes or bookstores in the Mountain View/Palo Alto area. &nbsp;Our go-to for the monthly book meeting is Books Inc, 301 Castro St, Mountain View- their staff have been very accommodating! &nbsp;You can buy our monthly books from our book club webpage on their website, http://www.booksinc.net/politcally-inspired-book-club</p>
<p>The environment we hold for our discussions is open and compassionate. Recognizing and honoring the different beliefs and political viewpoints, and seeking best to understand and explore. Six principles for dialogue:</p>
<p>6 principles common to most dialogue and circle groups guide the conversations: <br> . Suspend judgment as best you can <br> . Respect one another <br> . Seek to understand rather than persuade <br> . Invite and honor diversity of opinion <br> . Speak what has personal heart and meaning <br> . Go for honesty and depth without going on and on</p>

<p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.</p>

<p>This is our meeting page to gather and talk about how we plan to make California a safer place to live and also how we can help our brothers and sisters around the world protect their civil liberties and the environment that we rely on for survival.</p>
<p>We have a new Initiative ""California calls for Constitutional Convention"" - and a corresponding fundraising campaign that is LIVE now! Come to the page to review your own FAQs and to donate if you feel it meets your values and ideas for a better CA. We also now have a great website https://calconcon.initiative where you can see the focus of our Initiative.</p>
<p>The thinking was that a full on exist (Calexit) gave no room for discussion. We are holding that as a final choice, but putting a whole lot more focus on improving and securing progressive values for all people in America. So we're calling to amend the constitution itself!</p>
<p>Please stay with us. Please visit the fundraising page. Please ask questions.&nbsp;</p>

Code For Democracy SF,"<p>Who should join: You should join if the recent political climate has created in you a desire to ""do something"" and if you feel that a good way for you to do something will involve leveraging technology. The original Code For Democracy NYC group was founded on Jan 20th 2017, and is growing quickly. I hope and expect that we can develop a great group in SF to leverage tech for democracy, equality, and fact-based policy.</p> 
<p>What will we do: We are brand new, so I expect that the first meetup will center around 2 goals: 1. We will brainstorm ways that we can work together to make a difference, locally or at a national level. This can be through webapps, phone apps, novel dissemination of information, donating tech services, etc. 2. We will form groups around projects of merit discussed in step 2 and get to work.</p> 
<p>What we are NOT: 1. We are not a debate group. Of course, alignment on issues within the scope of each project will be important for efficacy and unity, but many of us spend many hours learning, debating, and evangelizing already; this group is for taking action. 2. We are not exclusive: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend and will be treated with respect.</p>"

Peninsula Feminist Book Club,"<p>Hello Feminists,</p>
<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>

<p>Please note, this meetup takes it for granted that papers of record such as the New York Times and Washington Post are, for the most part, trustworthy and reliable. If you feel certain that the government has engaged in conspiracies that these papers have failed to report or that these publications constitute 'fake news', this meetup may not be a good fit for you!</p>

Reformers for a New America,"<p><b><i>Our troubled age, and our mission -</i></b></p>
<p>In 21st century America, our most vital institutions - healthcare, education, government, the military, the media, the courts, and so forth - &nbsp;have been overtaken by a small group of financial elites, who have so entrenched and solidified their power through the accumulation of wealth, via the mechanisms of capitalism, that change has become all but impossible to enact within our current captive federal and local governments. In prolonged, unwinnable wars benefiting only defense contractors, environmental policy allowing for the oil industry's continued rape of the earth and contribution to ever-worsening climate change, crumbling infrastructure, and profit motivated deregulation resulting in, for one, the exposure of children to lead in their drinking water, the consequences of this seizure of power have infected, and are continuing to poison, day by day, the health of our citizenry.</p>
<p>While such corruption plays out, negatively effecting all in our nation but the few who are responsible for it, we as Americans remain divided over issues such as political affiliation and race. We forget in the midst of our fighting that our two political tribes, Democrat and Republican, are equally inept to meet our needs as individuals as long as they remain in the pockets of the wealthy, and special interests. And while the racism we see today cannot be said to be the result of class alone, having its roots as well in historical oppression, it has been inflamed severely by the marginalization and humiliation of impoverished peoples of all colors due to the widening wealth gap.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is thus to unite all - black, white, brown, people of every color, background, and creed - under the goal of reforming our nation so as to allow each and every individual equal opportunity to flourish, and to live free from poverty and the worry of poverty, on a clean, healthy planet. In so doing we seek to finally live up to the proclamation of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and to thus make our nation into what it should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Our means of systematic change will be massive nonviolent, non-cooperation with our current government, such that not a drop of blood will need to be shed for the purposes of taking back our power. All that will be needed will be a collective decision from the mass of citizenry, including law enforcement and military, that enough is enough, and we will not be challenged by the minority who are left to oppose us. It will then be left for us as citizenry to convene a new Continental Congress, as our founders once did, where we will debate and discuss, as they once did, the new, better nation that we wish to build out of the ashes of the old.</p>

Mission YIMBY,"<p>We want to build more housing in San Francisco so we can welcome new people into our community without displacing long term residents.</p>

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,"<p>Saving&nbsp;sharks for&nbsp;ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Sharks are symbols of ocean health.&nbsp;Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean.&nbsp;Until Now.</p>
<p>Today many species are threatened and could go&nbsp;extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.</p>Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.
<p><a href=""http://sharktober.com/sharkstewards/category/campaigns/"">Our campaigns</a>, e.g. the Healthy Oceans Initiative and Golden Gate Marine Protected Area Collaborative&nbsp;are directed towards raising awareness of shark conservation, sustainable fisheries, improved water quality and marine ecosystem protection. We advocate policy including the banning of shark finning, and regulating the shark fin trade in the USA and the Pacific Rim</p>

East Bay Teetotalers,"<p><span>Do you not like alcohol? Are you puzzled by the attraction of booze? Do you never drink alcohol? Do you dislike the smell of alcohol? Are you turned off by drunks? This group is for people who never drink alcoholic beverages - no wine, no beer, and no hard liquor. There is a group like this in San Francisco called Booze Free Fun (with over 1700 members as of June 30, 2017), which is great, but we are on this side of the bay. Sometimes it's just not easy to cross that bridge.</span><br></p>
<p>If you have never heard the word teetotaler before, it just means a person who never drinks alcohol. Its origin is available for a good reading on Wikipedia:</p>

Campbell Red Solo Cup Flag Football Meetup,"<p>Looking for Co-ed flag football players that are as interested in having fun yet competitive games at least once a month.</p>

<p>Some of the rules we play by:</p>
<p>- First team to 10 scores wins (with halftime at 5 scores). Games usually last about 75 minutes.</p>
<p>- No kickoffs. Possessions start at the 10 yard line. First downs are fixed lines at the 20, 40, and 20 yard lines.</p>
<p>- At least one female player on each team. - QB's are on a rotation. Everyone on the team must play QB before anyone can play QB again.</p>
<p>- QB's cannot scramble past the line of scrimmage at any time even if they get rushed by the defense after counting 7 ""mississippi""</p>
<p>The most important thing is that we all enjoy a competitive game while keeping in mind that having a fun time is the priority. <br> <br>Group rules: <br> <br>Understanding that life happens and unforeseen circumstances can prevent any of us from attending any particular event, a new set of group rules will be established and enforced. <br> <br> Members will be removed from the group if they: <br> - have been inactive for more than 2 months <br> - RSVP for and event and cancel within 2 days more than once <br> - RSVP for an event and do not show up <br> <br> The primary objective of the group is to get together, play football, meet new people, and have a great time.&nbsp; These rules will help prevent members investing time and money to attend an event to then have it canceled due to last minute cancellations or people not showing up. <br> Looking forward to meeting good people and having a great time.</p>"

Hiking With Laid Back Moms And Kids...and Other Outdoor Fun,"<p>This group is for chill, light hearted moms and kids who like to spend time outdoors. Whether you already spend time outdoors or want to explore the outdoors, you are welcome. Most activities won't be too strenuous or serious. My daughter is 9 years old, born in 2007. She is active and loves the outdoors. But, sometimes it's hard to motivate her to go on a hike with just me. Having other kids around always makes it more fun. I think it is important to nurture her love for the outdoors especially as she gets older and the preoccupation with the iPad increases. I plan to do one event a month with maybe some spontaneous events thrown in. Ideas I have for activities are hiking, kayaking, biking (when I finally get my hitch and bike rack), pool days, miniature golf, and potluck/BBQ at the park. I would also like to learn to play Pickle Ball...anyone know how to play already?<br>I would love any suggestions for activities.</p>"

DaVinci Homeschool Group,"<p>Welcome to the DaVinci Homeschool Group!</p>
<p>This friendly &amp; supportive group is geared for families who are actively homeschooling with at least one school aged child (siblings are always welcome). We are located in the SF East Bay Area, primarily in San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Castro Valley &amp; Hayward. Our weekly park day is on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>We are a secular group that encourages diversity and our members vary in homeschooling styles, religions, political views, family structures, and probably anything else you can think of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This group identifies as a community. Communities exist and thrive when all members are active and engaged. We are not just a network or a calendar of events, we are here for the connection. The things we do are possible because we are all working together to make this a fun, caring, and supportive homeschool community. We want to help our children build lasting friendships and at the same time build those kinds of relationships for ourselves too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our weekly park day is an important part of our community and the best place to come socialize and connect with the group. We expect every member to be an active participant and require members to attend an event at least once every 60 days, but that number is a bare minimum which we hope members strive to exceed. Our intention is for those who join the group to also be looking for a community that they can identify with and actively participate in. This group is more than just an online resource, we do need to see you in person. :)</p>
<p>We meet for field trips, art &amp; craft activities, park days, holiday parties, nature walks/hikes, social activities, and lots of hanging out and having fun. We feel that activities for our children are very important, but we also think that it's important for the parent who stays home to get some time to themselves too, so we have a parent's book club and a reoccurring parent's night (or day) out.</p>
<p>We don't offer classes or structured learning situations. To learn about those type of activities offered in the Bay Area, we recommend joining Bay Area Homeschool Field Trips (BAHFT) at <a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/groups/BAHFT"">https://groups.yahoo.com/groups/BAHFT</a> or checking out Outschool's calendar of events at outschool.com.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you soon!&nbsp;</p>

Spectrum,"<p> <br></p>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<br>
<p>Spectrum is a community for living fully and creating a healthy world.</p>
<br>
<p><a href=""https://www.spectrum-community.org"">www.spectrum-community.org</a></p>
<br>
<p>Our public (and private) events have been quite sparse lately, so don't expect to see frequent activity here.</p>
<br>
<p>One of our major long-term goals is to create an alternative to school for young people that is a superior way to live and learn. See our <a href=""https://www.spectrum-community.org/activity/youth-project/"">Youth Project</a>&nbsp;page for more information.</p>

CHAMPS Homeschool Group,"<p>We're a small group of Homeschool Moms, that started a Co-op Group a few years ago. We are looking to grow both our co-op day and our field trip group. We are looking for like-minded parents, interested in joining us on our field trips or our school day. We know our group isn't for everyone, so, come and get to know us and see if our group is right for you. We'll schedule field trips to the museum, park playdate, and nature hikes. We'd love to grow and become a great support system for our local area. Field trips will take place all over the East Bay. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>More info about our school day: &lt;br&gt;Champs Preparatory Academy, meets once a week, Wednesday, during the school year, from 11:00-3:00, in Pinole. We do fundraisers to support our school, take yearly camping trips with our whole family and celebrate selected holidays.</p>"
San Jose Homeschooling Meetup,"<p>This is a meetup for families who homeschool! We can plan fun field-trips, activities, park days, play-dates, and so much more! Open to all ages! If you have more ideas for this group, let me know!</p>"
Auburn Homeschooling Meetup,"<p>Hey brothers and sisters! <br>Let us create a strong home school community right here in Auburn. Whether you are already part of a co-op or support group, my hope is that we can all pull together so that everyone's want and needs are met. We will plan field trips, group discounts for community classes, play groups, volunteer opportunities, and much more, eventually maybe we can pull together and open our own learning center for homeschoolers and unschoolers alike! Children should be well rounded, taught life skills and have time to discover their passions. Setting the stage for a joyous life for our children is the best opportunity we can give them, weather they want to go to a university to be a doctor, or live a free life of traveling. Our goal is to recognize who each child is as early as possible and allow them every chance to thrive in their calling. Learning from and building relationships with other unique children of all ages will provide a rock solid community of support and encouragement. I look forward to hearing from you! Please shoot me an email at Auburnhomeschool@gmail.com</p>

Roseville/Rocklin Skateboarding for Teens and Homeschoolers,<p>We are looking for teenagers that skateboard that live in or near the Roseville and Rocklin areas. My son is 14 and homeschooled. He has no friends out here that skate. Let's go skate!</p>
POC Homeschoolers of Oakland,"<p>This is an intentional community/network for families of color who homeschool (or are interested in collective homeschooling). This group will hold a safe space for children and families of color where our children can honor their humanity and interact in race-positive environment. This is a safe space for families of all backgrounds, orientations, genders, and vaccination statuses. Our children will have the opportunity to interact and learn with kids of all ages who are raised to be kind, loving, and respectful to themselves and others. We are not religiously based but will be rooted in Universal/Spiritual principles such as love, humility, compassion, kindness and empathy. We will initially hold meetups for families, play dates, field trips and camping excursions in the East Bay area. If there is enough interest and support, we can expand into sharing teachers (or forming a school) for enhanced learning classes in music, art, permaculture, languages, STEM, etc.</p>
<p>We will also focus on character building and giving to others by being involved in community service projects and merging forces with other educational centers who support homeschooling.</p>
<p><b>How we work</b></p>
<p>If you're a member of this group, consider yourself a partner and co-creator. This group is about supporting a democratic, de-centralized process that allows everyone to contribute to our children's learning and experiences. This way, we can honor and support the diversity of ideas and perspectives we all bring to the table. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>In order to maintain a thriving and vibrant community, members are expected to participate in regular meetings, lead and organize events, as well as show up to and support each other's event.</p>"
Diablo Valley Homeschool Group,"<p>***Please note that all prospective members must first meet with the organizers at an event before membership requests are approved. Once you submit your information to join you will be contacted by one of our organizers with upcoming event information to chose from. Please make sure to check your Meetup Messages so you don't miss out!***</p>
<p>This community is focused on healthy, long lasting friendships and shared learning. The purpose of this group is to bring together families in the Contra Costa County and surrounding areas to build friendships, a support network, and cooperative learning opportunities. </p>
<p>Who are we? We are a group of families who share a passion for teaching our children through homeschooling. Our families currently range in ages from pre-k to middle school but all ages are welcome. We believe that children of all ages socializing together is a part of healthy development. </p>
<p>What do we do? We have weekly park days in the Contra Costa County areas. Additionally we have monthly Mom's Night Out and sometimes extend that to Parents' Night Out and Family Fun Nights. It is our goal to have other activities such as nature walks, movie nights, even co-op learning groups available for families to participate in. Families may participate in any and all events, but are welcome to opt out of any that don't meet their families needs or interests. </p>
<p>When do we meet? We get together every Friday at 10 A.M. for weekly park day play groups. Additional events will be scheduled at various times. </p>
<p>Where do we meet? For most events we meet somewhere in the East and Central areas of Contra Costa County. We may occasionally schedule field trips that are outside of the county as well. </p>
<p>How can your family participate? Join our group! We are always looking to make great connections for children and parents - the more the merrier! Send us a request to join and tell us a little bit about your family. Then come to a meetup and start making connections! <br><br></p>"
"Help for SHY KIDS!!  After School Park Days, Making Friends!","<p>I was inspired to start this group by our sweet, 8 year old daughter. Our daughter loves to interact and play with other kids, but needs more opportunities to develop social skills that help in making new friends. My hope is to provide the opportunity for more positive, fun experiences with other children, and offering the opportunity to gain more self confidence and social skills in the process. If you have a child who has difficulty at school or making new friends due to shyness, social anxiety, or similar, this may be an ideal group to help overcome some of these issues. We look forward to meeting other families and kiddos, hope to see you soon!</p>"
Davis activity partners,"<p>I'm Gerald, the fourth person to step up as the organizer for Davis Activity Partners. &nbsp;I've removed the annual fee requirement and will remove members who have been inactive for a while (you can always rejoin). &nbsp;Otherwise, I plan to keep the group running as it has before. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a group where <b>any member can post any type of event</b> that might be of interest to local residents. &nbsp;I generally only schedule hiking and fitness workout events, so I encourage others to post other types of events. &nbsp;Picnics in the park, movie nights, and group dinners have been popular in the past.</p>"
Appreciators of Fine Arts,"<p>This is a group for people who live in Sacramento, Davis, and surrounding areas who enjoy&nbsp;and appreciate fine arts - including paintings, photography, plays, dance, videos, music etc. &nbsp;It enables fine arts lovers to participate in - and hopefully initiate - activities in the Sacramento area as well as the S.F. Bay Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If members have any suggestions about exhibits or events that would be of interest, please let me know! I'm really looking forward to meeting other fine arts lovers and enjoying activities with them!&nbsp;- <i>Terry</i></p>

Cal Con Con - CA Calls for Constitutional Convention.,"<p><span>Hello &nbsp;Friend,&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>This is our meeting page to gather and talk about how we plan to make California a safer place to live and also how we can help our brothers and sisters around the world protect their civil liberties and the environment that we rely on for survival.</p>
<p>We have a new Initiative ""California calls for Constitutional Convention"" - and a corresponding fundraising campaign that is LIVE now! Come to the page to review your own FAQs and to donate if you feel it meets your values and ideas for a better CA. We also now have a great website https://calconcon.initiative where you can see the focus of our Initiative.</p>
<p>The thinking was that a full on exist (Calexit) gave no room for discussion. We are holding that as a final choice, but putting a whole lot more focus on improving and securing progressive values for all people in America. So we're calling to amend the constitution itself!</p>
<p>Please stay with us. Please visit the fundraising page. Please ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be more to follow. Right now, we are raising funds to file this new petition.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

SFDebate Political Discussion Meetup,"<p>The SF Debate Meetup is an open forum for discussion on the events of our time.

It is a place where you will not only be exposed to opposing points of view, but a safe place where you will be encouraged to find and speak up for yours. HAVE FUN, MAKE FRIENDS SFDebate is also good fun. It is a meeting of minds, and we follow every meeting with drinks , a bite to eat, and some drunken debate at a nearby bar/restaurant.

Decriminalize Prostitution!,"<p>We're a group of sex workers, clients, taxpayers, freedom lovers, and people from all walks of life working together to stop the immoral, wasteful, and futile practice of arresting and prosecuting consensual sexual acts.

While we were unsuccessful this time, we did receive over 41% of the vote, and served notice once again that our movement is not going away. Next time, Liberty willing, we will win! In the meantime, the ongoing work of organizing the sex work community and supporting each other when we are targeted by government or public intolerance, bigotry, or greed for our justly acquired earnings continues...

Sacramento Politics and Philosophy Group,"<p>This is a group for those in the Sacramento area who like to discuss politics and philosophy. We have all had different experiences in life, but we always find that political issues are very relevant to our lives and we want to discuss these issues with others. These days, political discussions are sometimes constructive, but unfortunately they often become hostile when people with differing views are in the same room. It is important for us all to hear views other than our own from time to time, and there has to be a way to have honest, thoughtful discussions on issues important to our lives while keeping the discussion calm and polite. In this discussion group, we try to avoid being overly biased when presenting opinions and we will also work to avoid use of fallacies in making points. We expect that there will be differences of opinion, but as long as we keep a philosophical mindset these discussions should not descend into hostility. Many of us also like to discuss philosophical topics and we will have time for this as well and we will probably find that most philosophical concepts have real-world applications, including political. So this discussion group will hover between these two subjects, and we might even at times focus on other subjects as well.</p>"

Berkeley Cannabis Distribution & Cultivation Action Group,"<p><span>Medical cannabis patients, caregivers, suppliers, cultivators, bakers, extractors, other product producers, activists, community groups, attorneys, city staff, elected officials, healthcare professionals, and business owners, will meet to discuss local cannabis issues especially cultivation, delivery, dispensaries, collectives, improving the status quo, achieving the most benefit for patients and community.</span><br></p>
<p><i><b>Thank you for contacting the Berkeley Cannabis Action Group. We initiated and formed from the interest of 2 current Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commissioners and several local cannabis cultivators and business operators. Specifically, we are currently primarily interested in spurring a recalcitrant Berkeley Mayor and City Council to act this fall in approving a cultivation ordinance and a cultivation licensing process in the city of Berkeley.&nbsp;</b></i></p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>FYI, the Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commission sent their recommended cultivation ordinance to the Mayor and BCC for review, approval and passage in March of 2015. Excuses given for the delay have been the lack of state legislation, which was indeed signed by Governor Brown in Oct. 2015!&nbsp;</b></i></p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>Regarding the cultivation licensing process, the cannabis commission cultivation subcommittee will meet Monday Aug. 22, 3:30 pm, Berkeley Planning Center, at the corner of Milvia and Center. We hope then to finalize and recommend a process to the full medical cannabis commission for approval at their Sept. 8 meeting. With commission approval, the cultivation licensing process will be sent to the Mayor and BCC for their review and passage.&nbsp;</b></i></p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>Upon medical cannabis commission cultivation licensing process recommendation, our Action Group then will meet to discuss possible strategy and tactics to persuade the Mayor and City Council to act in accordance with other jurisdictions (SF, Oakland, Richmond, Santa Cruz), who have all passed cultivation ordinances and licensing. Incidentally, we'll be reviewing the cultivation regulations of the fore-mentioned cities at the Aug. 22, cultivation subcommittee meeting.</b></i></p> 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>In the future and down the road, our Action Group will also lobby the Mayor and City Council regarding cannabis issues such as, delivery services, nurseries, state regulation and legalization. We likewise as well, encourage public participation and attention at Berkeley medical cannabis commission meetings.</b></i>&nbsp;</p>

DogPAC,"<p><b>DogPAC of SF</b>&nbsp;is a registered political action committee that focuses on the health and welfare of animals but primarily issues relating to dogs in the City &amp; County of San Francisco and beyond.</p>
<p>Dog advocates are as diverse as the breeds and mutts they care for. But when it comes to caring for animals there is a passionate bond that unites people in a common movement to improve the quality of life with pets. The committee has been recognized as a vanguard in bringing about policies that benefit the larger pet population and the people who care for them.</p>
<p><b>DogPAC of SF</b>&nbsp;advocates for the most pressing animal welfare issues that include greater access to housing for people with pets, shared use of parks and open space, and adequate City and County services to protect and treat animal populations. We have strong partnerships with animal shelters and rescues and with many organizations and community leaders who share a vision for animal welfare and responsible pet guardianship.</p>
<p>Considered one of the most pet-friendly cities, San Francisco alone has more than 150,000 dogs that are household members or waiting for an adoptive family. The entire SF Bay Area including visitor with their dogs far exceeds this many which warrants flexible policies to accommodate all.</p>

Folsom Corporatists,"<p>This meetup is for people who think that white civil rights are under attack, but don't believe that racism is the answer. Here we can meet and discuss the nature of ethnic corporatism in America, and how it might be made into a more positive force in society. As corporatists, we reject supremacy in all forms, e.g. race, class, religion, ideology, etc. Tyranny of the minority and tyranny of the majority are both tyrannies.</p>
<p>Sweden, Denmark and Germany are corporatist states. They apply corporatism to labor/business relations; Sweden in particular is known for a high degree of collaboration between capital and labor, to (great) mutual benefit, unlike the U.S.'s adversarial model. If the Swedes can resolve their economic conflicts peacefully and without hatred, surely we Americans can learn to approach our ethnic conflicts the same way.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to educate ourselves in how we might do that. &nbsp;Meetups will be based around various topics and presentations will be made.</p>"

Sacramento Politics and Philosophy Group,"<p>This is a group for those in the Sacramento area who like to discuss politics and philosophy. We have all had different experiences in life, but we always find that political issues are very relevant to our lives and we want to discuss these issues with others. These days, political discussions are sometimes constructive, but unfortunately they often become hostile when people with differing views are in the same room. It is important for us all to hear views other than our own from time to time, and there has to be a way to have honest, thoughtful discussions on issues important to our lives while keeping the discussion calm and polite. In this discussion group, we try to avoid being overly biased when presenting opinions and we will also work to avoid use of fallacies in making points. We expect that there will be differences of opinion, but as long as we keep a philosophical mindset these discussions should not descend into hostility. Many of us also like to discuss philosophical topics and we will have time for this as well and we will probably find that most philosophical concepts have real-world applications, including political. So this discussion group will hover between these two subjects, and we might even at times focus on other subjects as well.</p>"
Sac Feminists,"<p>Feminists come here to connect, find safe space, educate themselves, and educate each other on feminist issues. <br></p>

Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.</p>

Cal Con Con - CA Calls for Constitutional Convention.,"<p><span>Hello &nbsp;Friend,&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>This is our meeting page to gather and talk about how we plan to make California a safer place to live and also how we can help our brothers and sisters around the world protect their civil liberties and the environment that we rely on for survival.</p>
<p>We have a new Initiative ""California calls for Constitutional Convention"" - and a corresponding fundraising campaign that is LIVE now! Come to the page to review your own FAQs and to donate if you feel it meets your values and ideas for a better CA. We also now have a great website https://calconcon.initiative where you can see the focus of our Initiative.</p>
<p>The thinking was that a full on exist (Calexit) gave no room for discussion. We are holding that as a final choice, but putting a whole lot more focus on improving and securing progressive values for all people in America. So we're calling to amend the constitution itself!</p>
<p>Please stay with us. Please visit the fundraising page. Please ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be more to follow. Right now, we are raising funds to file this new petition.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

Palo Alto Radical Left Reading Group,"<p>Let's collectively create space for radical ideas (e.g. anarchism, critical animal studies, feminism, queer theory, social movements etc.). We aim to create a critical, reflexive, and non-hierarchical space for discussing radical praxis. All are welcome to attend, regardless of qualifications or experience with radical politics.</p>
<p>This is a group to read and discuss anti-capitalist practice and theory, by gathering a large body of radical literature, non-fiction, and theory, as well as a wide array of histories and analysis from intersecting movements for mutual aid, direct action, and the dismantling of oppressive hierarchies. We hope to cut across organizational boundaries to strengthen and unify the Left within our community.</p>"
San Jose Political Activism Meetup,"<p>People that are interested in holding our elected leaders accountable, upholding our constitution, improving civil rights for everyone, and eschewing various forms of discrimination, including, but not limited to racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, and bigotry. People that are socially liberal (civil rights, common sense regulation, abortion rights, marriage equality), fiscally conservative (reduced spending and national debt, balanced budget, limited government), and believe in American exceptionalism (democratic principles, free but fair trade, legal immigration, and a land of laws).</p>"
Placer Voices United #indivisible #resist,"<p>This is a grassroots group that will meet regularly to review Trump/right-wing policies in order to present our thoughts and feelings to our local Congressional Reps.

Code For Democracy SF,"<p>Who should join: You should join if the recent political climate has created in you a desire to ""do something"" and if you feel that a good way for you to do something will involve leveraging technology. The original Code For Democracy NYC group was founded on Jan 20th 2017, and is growing quickly. I hope and expect that we can develop a great group in SF to leverage tech for democracy, equality, and fact-based policy.</p> 
<p>What will we do: We are brand new, so I expect that the first meetup will center around 2 goals: 1. We will brainstorm ways that we can work together to make a difference, locally or at a national level. This can be through webapps, phone apps, novel dissemination of information, donating tech services, etc. 2. We will form groups around projects of merit discussed in step 2 and get to work.</p> 
<p>What we are NOT: 1. We are not a debate group. Of course, alignment on issues within the scope of each project will be important for efficacy and unity, but many of us spend many hours learning, debating, and evangelizing already; this group is for taking action. 2. We are not exclusive: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend and will be treated with respect.</p>"
#TheResistance San Francisco,"<p>Trump is #NotOurPresident - We are #TheResistance! We will organize and promote peaceful protests (We have <b>ZERO tolerance</b> <b>for violence</b> <b>or property damage</b>) and LOUDLY speak out against Trump. He does not speak for us - WE speak for us.</p>

Indivisible Resistors - Silicon Valley,"<p>We're young, old, straight, queer, white, not-white... just folk resisting Trump. <br> <br>Our starting point is ""The Indivisibility Guide"" (<a href=""https://www.indivisibleguide.com/guide/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.indivisibleguide.com/guide/</a>). &nbsp;Repeatedly contacting Congress is our core mission - by phone, by fax, by creative means. We &lt;3 town halls. <br> <br>Some of us also enjoy marches, many are dancers, and all of us like laughing, so we may have a flash mob in the dry season.</p>
<p>Commitment level varies widely and that is aok. <br> <br>We meet twice a month, reviewing, planning, connecting. <br> <br>Meetings are 7PM on 1st and 3rd Wednesdays.

<p>Welcome to the #resistance.</p>"
Folsom Corporatists,"<p>This meetup is for people who think that white civil rights are under attack, but don't believe that racism is the answer. Here we can meet and discuss the nature of ethnic corporatism in America, and how it might be made into a more positive force in society. As corporatists, we reject supremacy in all forms, e.g. race, class, religion, ideology, etc. Tyranny of the minority and tyranny of the majority are both tyrannies.</p>
<p>Sweden, Denmark and Germany are corporatist states. They apply corporatism to labor/business relations; Sweden in particular is known for a high degree of collaboration between capital and labor, to (great) mutual benefit, unlike the U.S.'s adversarial model. If the Swedes can resolve their economic conflicts peacefully and without hatred, surely we Americans can learn to approach our ethnic conflicts the same way.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to educate ourselves in how we might do that. &nbsp;Meetups will be based around various topics and presentations will be made.</p>"

The 15/30 Post Card Activists,"<p>Are you upset with the things happening in congress? Do you want to get your voice heard? This is the group for you!

San Jose Friends of the Pod (20s/30s),"<p>https://getcrookedmedia.com/here-have-a-podcast-78ee56b5a323</p>
<p>Do you listen to Pod Save America? Would you like to discuss the week's episodes with like-minded individuals for emotional support and a bit of fun? It's like a book club, but for a podcast. A pod club.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you like to vent to other liberals about the sad state of politics in our country? <br>Would you like to attempt to get involved in grassroots organizing to try to turn it all around? (I say attempt because I have no idea, but I'd like to try with help from others)</p>
<p>How about we do all of this while grabbing a drink to numb the disappointment? I'll be like happy hour, but for discouraged, young, liberals. Sounds like fun to me!</p>
<p>We should be open-minded and courteous during these discussions if/when we disagree. The Podcast episodes are a guideline for the topics of discussion, but feel free to bring up any other relevant topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>"
Open Forum : Grass Valley Philosophy and Politics Discussion,"<p>An open group for people of varying stances to discuss philosophy, politics, current events, and more, in a not only civil, but mutually enjoyable manner. As I'm sure many of you have noticed, its rather difficult to find people to talk about these big ideas with, let alone in a friendly and productive manner. Its hard to get a number of people's schedules and preferences to line up, so this group is started with the intention of splinter cells forming within it based on common interests and availability.</p>"
Friends of the Pod / Progressive News Junkies,"<p><span>Meet for dinner and vent about politics! I just moved to the Bay Area and I'm looking to meet people who love talking about progressive politics, who are possibly into activism or maybe just want to get into it about life in the era of Trump. Maybe you're into political podcasts like Pod Save America/the World/the People, Lovett or Leave it, NPR Politics Podcast, 538, maybe you check the NYtimes several times a day, maybe you love Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee etc., maybe you've been to a protest or two or many...or maybe you just want to have dinner and talk politics. If so this is for you!&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>Please note, this meetup takes it for granted that papers of record such as the New York Times and Washington Post are, for the most part, trustworthy and reliable. If you feel certain that the government has engaged in conspiracies that these papers have failed to report or that these publications constitute 'fake news', this meetup may not be a good fit for you!</p>
<p><span>First meetup is in San Mateo but if there is interest from people living in SF/East Bay we could have meetup dinners in the city. Leave a message on the group page if you have a suggestion for where you'd like to meet.</span> <br></p>"

Represent.Us Silicon Valley,"<p>Represent.Us is a non-partisan grassroots organization dedicated towards clean elections not influenced by big money and complete fidelity of elected officials to constituent needs rather than fidelity to personal gain (for example, political support, power, money, etc.) in the San Francisco peninsula and south bay.</p> 
<p>Bring together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to reduce corruption* in the San Francisco peninsula and south bay geographies by driving:<br> - Campaign finance reform<br> - Campaign finance disclosure standards<br> - Representative districting<br> - Election process reform<br> - Public financing</p> 
<p>Our strategy revolves around passing laws throughout the different towns and cities of Silicon Valley, as well as the state of California. We are a local chapter of a national organization that has passed binding legislation regarding campaign finance reform in places like Florida, South Dakota, Seattle, Massachusetts, Maine, and many other jurisdictions, including the city of San Francisco itself, where we have another chapter. The national organization includes on its board figures like Trevor Potter, former FEC chair, and Larry Lessig, outspoken critic of how money turns heads in American politics. Learn more about our national organization at www.represent.us.</p>

The Magic Money Tree Project,"<p>What most people know about money is wrong and this is creating massive societal problems.&nbsp; The goal of the Magic Money Tree Project is to build grassroots literacy of political economics (how political and economic systems interact).&nbsp; We create, share, and disseminate educational tools and materials to build literacy on key societal issues.&nbsp; We work on a grassroots level to understand the issues real people face in their daily lives. We help build understanding of how political and economic systems work in ways that are relevant and understandable to them.</p>
<p>This project's goal is not to promote a specifically liberal or conservative agenda.&nbsp; Liberals and conservatives both contribute to society.&nbsp; We count them among our friends, family, members of the community, countrymen, and fellows in humanity.&nbsp; We can improve society by learning to understand people different from us because we all have shared interests and goals.</p>
<p>This project is also not directly concerned with party politics.&nbsp; However, understanding political economy opens up new possibilities for policy and political action.</p>"
Mission YIMBY,"<p>We want to build more housing in San Francisco so we can welcome new people into our community without displacing long term residents.</p> 
<p>We believe in affordable housing for everyone; that means we must build more of all kinds of housing. We are strongly in favor of subsidized affordable housing to ensure that people from every income bracket can share in our beautiful and vibrant city. And we are also in favor of market rate housing because not everyone qualifies for subsidized below-market rate housing.</p> 
<p>We must ensure the middle class can live here by lowering the cost of construction, making it easier to build, upzoning the west side, and concentrating dense housing around public transit. San Francisco is for everyone!</p>"
San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

<p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy?

Concord Social and Economic Equity Meetup,"This is a group for anyone who is concerned about increasing social and economic inequalities in the U.S. and wants to do something to change it. Neto Community Network is a nonprofit organization that sponsors this group. This is a chance to meet other people who care about any aspect of equality--economic, educational, health, gender, or other forms of social equity. The more diverse the perspectives and interests, the more fun and interesting the group is. The format varies with the ideas participants bring-watching movies, talking about stuff you've read, discussing your own experience. We urge people to share food and drink, and have a great time getting to know like-minded people from all kinds of backgrounds, and discussing and working on these fascinating and important issues."

Loomis Peace Studies,"<p>This group will consist of individuals concerned about one or more aspects of global conflict, ethnic or religious conflict, political strife, and environmental and species degradation. Meetings will include open discussion with a strong focus on the facts and a definite disavowal of ideological lobbying &amp; doctrinal righteousness.

At meetings members will be invited to share facts and other outcomes of their independent research and investigation. We will also discuss strategies for effective conflict resolution. This is not a meditation or inner peace group. Members have an ""activist"" orientation to positive change in the world and hold themselves responsible for timely research to be shared.</p>"

Cal Con Con - CA Calls for Constitutional Convention.,"<p><span>Hello &nbsp;Friend,&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>This is our meeting page to gather and talk about how we plan to make California a safer place to live and also how we can help our brothers and sisters around the world protect their civil liberties and the environment that we rely on for survival.</p>
<p>We have a new Initiative ""California calls for Constitutional Convention"" - and a corresponding fundraising campaign that is LIVE now! Come to the page to review your own FAQs and to donate if you feel it meets your values and ideas for a better CA. We also now have a great website https://calconcon.initiative where you can see the focus of our Initiative.</p>
<p>The thinking was that a full on exist (Calexit) gave no room for discussion. We are holding that as a final choice, but putting a whole lot more focus on improving and securing progressive values for all people in America. So we're calling to amend the constitution itself!</p>
<p>Please stay with us. Please visit the fundraising page. Please ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be more to follow. Right now, we are raising funds to file this new petition.</p>

Code For Democracy SF,"<p>Who should join: You should join if the recent political climate has created in you a desire to ""do something"" and if you feel that a good way for you to do something will involve leveraging technology. The original Code For Democracy NYC group was founded on Jan 20th 2017, and is growing quickly. I hope and expect that we can develop a great group in SF to leverage tech for democracy, equality, and fact-based policy.</p> 
<p>What will we do: We are brand new, so I expect that the first meetup will center around 2 goals: 1. We will brainstorm ways that we can work together to make a difference, locally or at a national level. This can be through webapps, phone apps, novel dissemination of information, donating tech services, etc. 2. We will form groups around projects of merit discussed in step 2 and get to work.</p> 
<p>What we are NOT: 1. We are not a debate group. Of course, alignment on issues within the scope of each project will be important for efficacy and unity, but many of us spend many hours learning, debating, and evangelizing already; this group is for taking action. 2. We are not exclusive: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend and will be treated with respect.</p>"

Reformers for a New America,"<p><b><i>Our troubled age, and our mission -</i></b></p>
<p>In 21st century America, our most vital institutions - healthcare, education, government, the military, the media, the courts, and so forth - &nbsp;have been overtaken by a small group of financial elites, who have so entrenched and solidified their power through the accumulation of wealth, via the mechanisms of capitalism, that change has become all but impossible to enact within our current captive federal and local governments. In prolonged, unwinnable wars benefiting only defense contractors, environmental policy allowing for the oil industry's continued rape of the earth and contribution to ever-worsening climate change, crumbling infrastructure, and profit motivated deregulation resulting in, for one, the exposure of children to lead in their drinking water, the consequences of this seizure of power have infected, and are continuing to poison, day by day, the health of our citizenry.</p>
<p>While such corruption plays out, negatively effecting all in our nation but the few who are responsible for it, we as Americans remain divided over issues such as political affiliation and race. We forget in the midst of our fighting that our two political tribes, Democrat and Republican, are equally inept to meet our needs as individuals as long as they remain in the pockets of the wealthy, and special interests. And while the racism we see today cannot be said to be the result of class alone, having its roots as well in historical oppression, it has been inflamed severely by the marginalization and humiliation of impoverished peoples of all colors due to the widening wealth gap.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is thus to unite all - black, white, brown, people of every color, background, and creed - under the goal of reforming our nation so as to allow each and every individual equal opportunity to flourish, and to live free from poverty and the worry of poverty, on a clean, healthy planet. In so doing we seek to finally live up to the proclamation of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and to thus make our nation into what it should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Our means of systematic change will be massive nonviolent, non-cooperation with our current government, such that not a drop of blood will need to be shed for the purposes of taking back our power. All that will be needed will be a collective decision from the mass of citizenry, including law enforcement and military, that enough is enough, and we will not be challenged by the minority who are left to oppose us. It will then be left for us as citizenry to convene a new Continental Congress, as our founders once did, where we will debate and discuss, as they once did, the new, better nation that we wish to build out of the ashes of the old.</p>

Mission YIMBY,"<p>We want to build more housing in San Francisco so we can welcome new people into our community without displacing long term residents.</p>

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

Santa Cruz March for Elephants,"<p>Come meet with us to learn about life for elephants throughout the world. We will discuss the current crisis facing elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia, the plight of captive elephants around the globe and what we can do to help them. Currently, 35,000+ elephants are being killed by poachers each year for their tusks. At this rate, elephants in Africa will be extinct in less than 10 years. A rhino is killed at least every 11 hours for its horn. We've already lost the Western Black Rhino to extinction. With only 29,000 white rhinos remaining, we want to raise awareness about this crisis and work to stop the needless slaughter before it's too late. We will also discuss the plight of captive elephants who need us to speak out on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of this group is to spread the word about the plight of elephants and rhinos throughout our local community through tabling, education, presentations, marching and participating in ongoing activities with March for Elephants in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're interested in volunteering to help elephants and rhinos from becoming extinct or from living in unnecessary suffering and loneliness, please join Santa Cruz March for Elephants. You can also contact us by email at scmarchforelephants@gmail.com</p>

San Francisco for Elephants and Rhinos,"<p><b>Join to help end the extinction of the earth's last Elephants and Rhinos.</b><br>

<br>

 <i><b>This is the opportunity for all San Francisco and Bay Area residents to come together to determine creative and imaginative ways on ending the ivory and rhino horn trade in California and the world.</b></i><br>

<br>

 Did you know that California is the second largest market in the USA for illegal ivory?<br>

<br>

 Did you know that China is the largest market for ivory in the world, and has 37+ ivory carving factories and more than 145 ivory retail outlets; a steady stream of ivory from Africa, from brutally poached elephants sustains the ivory market in China.<br>

<br>

 Did you also know? Up to 50,000 Elephants are being killed every year so their tusks can be carved into ivory trinkets. A Rhino is slaughtered once every 9-11 hours for Rhino Horn. Their only hope for survival lies in an immediate end to the ivory and rhino horn trade (both ""legal"" and ""illegal"") and a meaningful opportunity to recover from decades of mass slaughter. The countdown to elephant and rhino extinction has begun - unless action is taken now, we will lose these majestic, highly intelligent, and emotionally sentient creatures FOREVER. Join us! March against extinction. Let's meet to discuss ways to end the trade!</p>"

Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,"<p>Saving&nbsp;sharks for&nbsp;ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Sharks are symbols of ocean health.&nbsp;Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean.&nbsp;Until Now.</p>
<p>Today many species are threatened and could go&nbsp;extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.</p>Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.
<p><a href=""http://sharktober.com/sharkstewards/category/campaigns/"">Our campaigns</a>, e.g. the Healthy Oceans Initiative and Golden Gate Marine Protected Area Collaborative&nbsp;are directed towards raising awareness of shark conservation, sustainable fisheries, improved water quality and marine ecosystem protection. We advocate policy including the banning of shark finning, and regulating the shark fin trade in the USA and the Pacific Rim</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Join Shark Stewards and LUSH Cosmetics in a public shout out for sharks on Saturday 10/22 at the LUSH store at Mandalay Bay. Wear your shark suit and bring your mermaids and little fish and attend this publicity event to support the Federal Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act. Las Vegas is ground zero in the US for shark fin soup. <br>We are seeking signers for the petition and raising awareness on saving sharks from extinction. 10- 5PM at LUSH.</p>"

Oakland Rescue Dog Shelter Helpers (Volunteering Meetup),"<p><span>So many dog rescue agencies in the East Bay need help with dog walking and socialization (a.k.a. playing, cuddling, etc). This not only helps the dogs relieve stress and stay healthy, but it makes them more sociable and likely to be adopted. And every dog that is quickly moved through the shelter system is another dog saved! Plus, playing with these dogs is SO MUCH FUN! Unfortunately, with shelters short on volunteers, this does not get done nearly enough. This group is dedicated to finding creative ways to support local dog rescue agencies. We will have great volunteer opportunities that can fit with anyone's schedule. You just have to love dogs and want to help!</span> <br> <br>To streamline your acceptance into the group, please fill out the following form: www.goo.gl/N3bhXA.</p>"

<p>We are a friendly, informal group of shooting enthusiasts with a reserved range event on the 4th Sunday of each month and a shared outreach beginner shooting event on the 2nd Saturday of each month..</p>
<p>The San Jose Municipal 10th street range&nbsp;is&nbsp;our ""home range"", it is&nbsp;at 1580 South 10th Street, San Jose California&nbsp;95112.</p>
<p>In addition to our regular monthly events, we will have other outings where we will travel to other ranges.</p>
<p>Due to the social nature of our group, most of us have multiple guns and typically we always try out each others guns.&nbsp; The custom in our group is if you are shooting someone else's gun, reimburse them for their ammunition.</p>
<p>For our events, we have been getting together for lunch or dinner&nbsp;after shooting so that we can socialize, where we go depends on mood of the group. </p>
<p>Interested, but don't have a firearm? If so, this is the group to join. In our group you will find a welcoming environment for beginners, our members especially enjoy mentoring new shooters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Typically between all of us who attend we have a wide variety of firearms and experience.</p>
<p>For someone who is new to anything, often many times a new person won't even know what questions to even ask, we will help guide you to figure what questions to ask and hopefully we will have satisfactory answers to your questions.</p>
<p>We will show you how to shoot ""Safely"" and have a lot of ""Fun"" doing so.</p>
<p>And for those of you who are ""experienced shooters"", of course you are welcome and we welcome you to come share your experiences so that all of us can grow.</p>
<p>For those of you looking for more ""advanced training"", as a group we will be making 2 plus road trips to Front Sight Training in Pahrump, Nevada. Front Sight is 70 miles from Las Vegas. It is ""legal"" to transport firearms on commercial planes in ""screened and checked in"" baggage.</p>

Santa Cruz March for Elephants,"<p>Come meet with us to learn about life for elephants throughout the world. We will discuss the current crisis facing elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia, the plight of captive elephants around the globe and what we can do to help them. Currently, 35,000+ elephants are being killed by poachers each year for their tusks. At this rate, elephants in Africa will be extinct in less than 10 years. A rhino is killed at least every 11 hours for its horn. We've already lost the Western Black Rhino to extinction. With only 29,000 white rhinos remaining, we want to raise awareness about this crisis and work to stop the needless slaughter before it's too late. We will also discuss the plight of captive elephants who need us to speak out on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of this group is to spread the word about the plight of elephants and rhinos throughout our local community through tabling, education, presentations, marching and participating in ongoing activities with March for Elephants in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're interested in volunteering to help elephants and rhinos from becoming extinct or from living in unnecessary suffering and loneliness, please join Santa Cruz March for Elephants. You can also contact us by email at scmarchforelephants@gmail.com</p>

San Francisco for Elephants and Rhinos,"<p><b>Join to help end the extinction of the earth's last Elephants and Rhinos.</b><br>

<br>

 <i><b>This is the opportunity for all San Francisco and Bay Area residents to come together to determine creative and imaginative ways on ending the ivory and rhino horn trade in California and the world.</b></i><br>

<br>

 Did you know that California is the second largest market in the USA for illegal ivory?<br>

<br>

 Did you know that China is the largest market for ivory in the world, and has 37+ ivory carving factories and more than 145 ivory retail outlets; a steady stream of ivory from Africa, from brutally poached elephants sustains the ivory market in China.<br>

<br>

 Did you also know? Up to 50,000 Elephants are being killed every year so their tusks can be carved into ivory trinkets. A Rhino is slaughtered once every 9-11 hours for Rhino Horn. Their only hope for survival lies in an immediate end to the ivory and rhino horn trade (both ""legal"" and ""illegal"") and a meaningful opportunity to recover from decades of mass slaughter. The countdown to elephant and rhino extinction has begun - unless action is taken now, we will lose these majestic, highly intelligent, and emotionally sentient creatures FOREVER. Join us! March against extinction. Let's meet to discuss ways to end the trade!</p>"

Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,"<p>Saving&nbsp;sharks for&nbsp;ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Sharks are symbols of ocean health.&nbsp;Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean.&nbsp;Until Now.</p>
<p>Today many species are threatened and could go&nbsp;extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.</p>Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.
<p><a href=""http://sharktober.com/sharkstewards/category/campaigns/"">Our campaigns</a>, e.g. the Healthy Oceans Initiative and Golden Gate Marine Protected Area Collaborative&nbsp;are directed towards raising awareness of shark conservation, sustainable fisheries, improved water quality and marine ecosystem protection. We advocate policy including the banning of shark finning, and regulating the shark fin trade in the USA and the Pacific Rim</p>

<p>Join Shark Stewards and LUSH Cosmetics in a public shout out for sharks on Saturday 10/22 at the LUSH store at Mandalay Bay.

Intellectual Property Rights,"<p><b>This MeetUp is for Businesses, Managers and Executives.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Intellectual property</b>&nbsp;refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.&nbsp;<b>Intellectual property</b>&nbsp;is divided into two categories: Industrial&nbsp;<b>Property</b>&nbsp;includes patents for inventions, trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications.&nbsp;(wipo.int)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intellectual property protection is critical to fostering innovation. Without protection of ideas, businesses and individuals would not reap the full benefits of their inventions and would focus less on research and development. Similarly, artists would not be fully compensated for their creations and cultural vitality would suffer as a result. (topfakes.gov)<br></p>
<p>Great fortunes have been lost due to not having a patent. Some businesses don't realize that they have created something new that can be patented, and that their patent can become a valuable asset increasing the overall worth of the company. This protection allows businesses to control their market and keep competitors at bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</p>

<p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.</p>

<p>This is our meeting page to gather and talk about how we plan to make California a safer place to live and also how we can help our brothers and sisters around the world protect their civil liberties and the environment that we rely on for survival.</p>
<p>We have a new Initiative ""California calls for Constitutional Convention"" - and a corresponding fundraising campaign that is LIVE now! Come to the page to review your own FAQs and to donate if you feel it meets your values and ideas for a better CA. We also now have a great website https://calconcon.initiative where you can see the focus of our Initiative.</p>
<p>The thinking was that a full on exist (Calexit) gave no room for discussion. We are holding that as a final choice, but putting a whole lot more focus on improving and securing progressive values for all people in America. So we're calling to amend the constitution itself!</p>
<p>Please stay with us. Please visit the fundraising page. Please ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be more to follow. Right now, we are raising funds to file this new petition.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

Palo Alto Radical Left Reading Group,"<p>Let's collectively create space for radical ideas (e.g. anarchism, critical animal studies, feminism, queer theory, social movements etc.). We aim to create a critical, reflexive, and non-hierarchical space for discussing radical praxis. All are welcome to attend, regardless of qualifications or experience with radical politics.</p>
<p>This is a group to read and discuss anti-capitalist practice and theory, by gathering a large body of radical literature, non-fiction, and theory, as well as a wide array of histories and analysis from intersecting movements for mutual aid, direct action, and the dismantling of oppressive hierarchies. We hope to cut across organizational boundaries to strengthen and unify the Left within our community.</p>"

Peninsula Feminist Book Club,"<p>Hello Feminists,</p>
<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>

This means better futures for our children, better opportunities in the work place, and fighting for the dignity and respect we deserve. No matter what background, economic status, sexual orientation, or education you may have, you are welcome in joining La Nueva Causa-The New Cause.</p>

We battle mental illness, feelings of alienation, underemployment, and hopelessness, but have a sneaking feeling that we aren't really the problem.

Reformers for a New America,"<p><b><i>Our troubled age, and our mission -</i></b></p>
<p>In 21st century America, our most vital institutions - healthcare, education, government, the military, the media, the courts, and so forth - &nbsp;have been overtaken by a small group of financial elites, who have so entrenched and solidified their power through the accumulation of wealth, via the mechanisms of capitalism, that change has become all but impossible to enact within our current captive federal and local governments. In prolonged, unwinnable wars benefiting only defense contractors, environmental policy allowing for the oil industry's continued rape of the earth and contribution to ever-worsening climate change, crumbling infrastructure, and profit motivated deregulation resulting in, for one, the exposure of children to lead in their drinking water, the consequences of this seizure of power have infected, and are continuing to poison, day by day, the health of our citizenry.</p>
<p>While such corruption plays out, negatively effecting all in our nation but the few who are responsible for it, we as Americans remain divided over issues such as political affiliation and race. We forget in the midst of our fighting that our two political tribes, Democrat and Republican, are equally inept to meet our needs as individuals as long as they remain in the pockets of the wealthy, and special interests. And while the racism we see today cannot be said to be the result of class alone, having its roots as well in historical oppression, it has been inflamed severely by the marginalization and humiliation of impoverished peoples of all colors due to the widening wealth gap.</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is thus to unite all - black, white, brown, people of every color, background, and creed - under the goal of reforming our nation so as to allow each and every individual equal opportunity to flourish, and to live free from poverty and the worry of poverty, on a clean, healthy planet. In so doing we seek to finally live up to the proclamation of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and to thus make our nation into what it should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Our means of systematic change will be massive nonviolent, non-cooperation with our current government, such that not a drop of blood will need to be shed for the purposes of taking back our power. All that will be needed will be a collective decision from the mass of citizenry, including law enforcement and military, that enough is enough, and we will not be challenged by the minority who are left to oppose us. It will then be left for us as citizenry to convene a new Continental Congress, as our founders once did, where we will debate and discuss, as they once did, the new, better nation that we wish to build out of the ashes of the old.</p>

"Civil Rights History Discussion Group, SF","<p>In this group we'll dive deep into the many dimensions of the struggle for racial justice in twentieth-century America, and we'll have a helluva lot of fun while we do it! Over drinks, each month we'll discuss something fascinating from the spectrum of racial justice history - armed resistance; nonviolence; profound strategy; successes and failures; deep context; multiracial alliance building; nefarious tactics of divisiveness; histories of whiteness and structural and strategic racism; radical women and powerful youth; the profound legacy of LGBT figures in black and brown freedom struggles; grassroots mobilizations... This will be all about learning deeply about important issues, while having excellent conversations and building community. <br></p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Structure</p>
<p>- This will be about everyone's voice being present, as long as they wish it to be... about everyone being able to express their ideas, ask their questions, be fully heard, and engage in meaningful dialog. There will be a facilitator, but we should practice the good ol' step up/step back. <br></p>
<p>- The readings each month will be somewhere between 10 to 20 pages; so it will be very accessible to folks with busy lives.&nbsp; However, it will be deep.&nbsp; Please read the material if you plan on attending.&nbsp; If you start but don't quite make it through, no worries, please come! <br></p>
<p>- As you read, think of these three things: What parts of the story most interest you? Is there anything you feel confusion about or want more clarity around? Are their connections you can draw between the story and the present moment? Considering these three things as you read will ensure especially awesome conversations! <br></p>
<p>- If the struggle for racial justice is something you have deep knowledge about and feel absolutely comfortable talking about, bring your wisdom! If this subject is new to you and it feels super heavy and you feel a little uneasy talking about it but you know its important and you want to figure it out, this is the perfect place for you too!&nbsp; We'll help you build up your knowledge and develop your voice, and we'll have fun.&nbsp; Let's make this a space for helping one another along the path; wherever we are on the path. <br></p>

Immigration Options for Researchers,"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in learning about EB-1 green cards, particularly Researchers, Professors, Executives, &amp; Entrepreneurs. We'll have a series of 4 to 5 meetings where we'll discuss the following fast-track green cards: EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability), EB-1B (Outstanding Researchers/Professors), and EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver). We'll also discuss the O-1 visa, which is a great alternative to an H-1B for researchers and other top performers.</p> 
<p>Do you have to have a Nobel Prize to qualify? (Spoiler...no, you don't.) How strong is your case? When, if at all, will international travel be limited during the green card process? Is the EB-1 Priority Date really backlogged for India and China?</p> 
<p>We'll go over all of this and more, and there will be lots of time for questions about specific circumstances. Come join the EB-1 fun!</p>"

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"
