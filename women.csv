Reproductive Justice Reading Group,"<p>We are a reading group dedicated to understanding how our culture oppresses women by controlling their reproductive lives. Issues to be discussed include access to sex education, contraception and abortion, as well as reproductive healthcare, parental leave, and affordable childcare. We will also discuss social pressures to have or not have children, silence around abortion, miscarriage and infertility, and pressures upon women to engage in ever-more ""intensive mothering."" We will explore these issues from a variety of perspectives, acknowledging that that they impact women of different racial identities, classes, and sexual identities in different ways. We also acknowledge that different groups of women have vastly different histories of experiencing reproductive oppression.</p>"

Starting Over Now - A Women's Group,"<p>In these turbulent times many women find themselves in a place of having to start over for various reasons: after marriages or relationships have broken up, children have left the home, illness or distress has changed their life. All these issues can create huge emotional, spiritual, and physical pain in your life. This group will help you find not only new people that have endured your situation but a place to be safe and find some ideas on how to adapt. Change is hard but it is in the difficulties that we find our true spirit. Join this group that meets the first Friday of the month.</p>"
SVF Tech Women,"<p>Meet other women (and men) who are interested in empowering women in all kinds of technology and encouraging girls to pursue education in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) that will prepare them for career opportunities in technology.</p>
<p>Discuss topical strategies for advancement, handling issues in the workplace, personal and professional development as well as the emerging technologies of interest.</p>"
Goddess Blossom Women's Circles,"<p>We are a group of mothers, daughters, healers and artists who treasure wellness as the most precious gift and believe that healing comes from many different places: from the sun, rain, wind; from beauty and love; from art and poetry; from plants and kind hands; from knowledge and intuition; from indigenous culture and scientific minds; we are beautiful women who gather to share, to learn, to rest and to inspire.</p>"
Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>"

<p><span>We believe in fostering the independent, strong woman inside of every one of us.</span></p>

Santa Cruz Women Hiking,"<p>Dear fellow hikers or potential hikers,</p>
<p>I love hiking in the fresh air of mountain and sea, and want to join with other women in exploring hiking trails in Santa Cruz and neighboring counties. My goal is to get good exercise, enjoy good company, and experience the serenity and inspiration of the great outdoors.</p>
<p>Most of the hikes I will organize will be in the 3- to 7- mile range with a gain of 200 to 2000 feet. &nbsp;There are other organizers, however, who may do longer and/or more difficult hikes. If you're not ready to do the longer steeper hikes, try the easier ones! You are also welcome to come and do a portion of a hike, then return on your own. That's how I got started!</p>
<p>This group is for women of any age, who love hiking in beautiful natural spaces, or who would like to give it a try! It's also a relaxed and easy way to make new friends :)</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the group or the hikes, feel free to send me an email.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Kitty</p>
<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p>I will do my best to describe the level of difficulty of each hike, so you can decide if the hike is right for you. I'll use the descriptions below to indicate how much uphill there is. In addition to the uphill, please take into consideration how long the hike is. A hike may be described as moderately easy, but if it's 6 or 7 miles long, that distance may be too much for you at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Moderately easy</strong> = Up and down, but total elevation gain of less than 400 feet. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> = Total gain 400 to 800 feet. Lots of up and down. Can be steep stretches, but no really long steep uphill stretches. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderately difficult</strong> = Total gain greater than 800 feet. May be some really steep sections and/or very long stretches of uphill. <br></p>"

Wicca Wimmin's Moon Ritual of Marin,"<p>Blessed Be Sister! This is a Wiccan Full Moon Ritual of Pagan Goddess Worship for women, to celebrate our femininity and nurture our souls. This Sister Circle loosely follows Starhawk's style in her book The Spiral Dance. We will call in the four directions, invoke the Goddess, join our energies and raise up the cone of power to bless the world, each other, the cauldron and ourselves. The Ritual is very inclusive and you may bring things to put on the altar, or put in the cauldron to be blessed. Bring your drums and magic tools, and anything that honors the Goddess, wimmin, and your natural yin. This is a celebration of our womanhood, free of the male dynamic, for our spirits to be strengthened in total safety, &nbsp;and our souls healed. Join and enjoy as we honor each other's natural womanhood, to consciously align our selves with Mother Nature's cycles. The Full Moon energy is for fullfillment of life, love, health and all goodness. Ritual is followed by a vegetarian pot luck.</p>
<p>Brothers, men, do not join this group. &nbsp;You will be banned. Please, give your invasive and disrespectful bothers a pull up and tell them to honor our boundary. If you are genuinely interested in Wicca, read The Spiral Dance by Starhawk, and join my meetup Wicca and Witchcraft Training, then you may call me, Reverend Joey Talley, at 415.990.6020&nbsp;</p>"

Girl Develop It San Jose,"<p>Women Developers and Programmers!<br>

 Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.</p>
<p><br>

 It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask ""stupid questions.""</p>
<p><br>

 We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>

Embodied Voice for Relationships,"<p>If you want more depth in your relationships, this is the right group for you. Whether you are in a partnership right now or you're single, come and learn how to create an even deeper level of intimacy in all the relationships in your life. This includes professional relationships, friendships, family dynamics and anything in between.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cornerstone to every relationship is communication and communication starts by using your voice to communicate your needs and desires. The problem is, most people don't know how to use their voice effectively, so even when you say exactly what you want, your partner doesn't hear you. Frustrating when that happens, isn't it? What would it be like if you could communicate your desires clearly and effectively <b>and</b>&nbsp;have your partner fulfill those desires? That is not only possible, we're here to show you how you can create this reality in your life.</p>
<p>Learning to speak from your body allows you not only to be heard - you will be felt in a way you have probably never experienced before. Learn how to use your voice to attract and keep the relationships you desire in your life. Find your authentic voice, and notice how much different it sounds than the way you currently sound when you speak. Feel the power of your own voice in a way you have yet to experience. Isn't it time for you to create the amazing relationships you have always wanted? Join us, and make these dreams a reality.</p>"
Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

FEMININE PROSPERITY Meetup Group,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>I created this group because I have found that women thrive when they are an integral part of a loving, supportive, emotionally healthy community.</p>
<p>We've heard many spiritual teachers, and now scientists as well, telling us that we really do create our own reality. But we have been programmed from our earliest years with lies about who we are and what we are capable of doing and being. In order to reverse that programming from our parents, our schools, our media and our entire society, we need a lot of support. We need a community consisting of loving people who take 100% responsibility for their lives and challenge you to do the same. We need a clear system to follow which teaches us how to dance with the Law of Attraction in a way that really works. Through exciting, transformational events, supportive meetings and fun activities, we are committed to keeping our vibration HIGH as much of the time as possible. Feeling wonderful, laughing, loving, creating ordinary miracles attracts more of the same! Come join us on our wild joyride!</p>

Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles,"<p>Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles are for women who want a safe, shame-free space to discuss sexuality. &nbsp;We share our stories, gain strength from each other, learn about our bodies, discuss orgasm, sexual preferences, sexual styles, body image, sexual shame &amp; trauma, and heal any wounds we may have around our sexual experiences. &nbsp;We will gain insight from HomePlay exercises specifically designed to empower us as women on this transformational journey.</p>
<p>LOTUS blooms as:</p>
<p>Loving Ourselves Fully</p>
<p>Opening to Orgasm</p>
<p>Trusting Our Authentic Expressions</p>
<p>Union with Self, Beloved &amp; Divine</p>
<p>Surrendering to Satisfaction</p>
<p>In Opening the LOTUS circles we explore each one of these themes through story telling, group activities, diad work, online instruction and sex education.</p>
<p>The Lotus Flower has long been used in eastern spirituality to symbolize female sexuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Taken from</span><a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com""> mythencyclopedia.com</a></p>
<p><i>""In Asian mythology the lotus often symbolizes the female sexual organs, from which new life is born. Lotuses appear in both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Hindus refer to the god Brahma as ""lotus-born "" for he is said to have emerged from a lotus that was the navel, or center, of the universe. The lotus is also the symbol of the goddess Padma, who appears on both Hindu and Buddhist monuments as a creative force.</i></p>
<p><i>The holiness of the flower is illustrated by the legend that when the Buddha walked on the earth he left lotuses in his trail instead of footprints. One myth about the origin of Buddha relates that he first appeared floating on a lotus. According to a Japanese legend, the mother of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Nichiren.html"">Nichiren</a>&nbsp;(Lotus of the Sun) became pregnant by dreaming of sunshine on a lotus. Nichirin founded a branch of Buddhism in the 1200s. The phrase ""Om mani padme hum,"" which both Hindus and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Buddhism.html"">Buddhists</a>&nbsp;use in meditation, means ""the jewel in the lotus"" and can refer to the Buddha or to the mystical union of male and female energies"".</i></p>
<p>Opening the LOTUS as Love, Orgasm, Trust, Union &amp; Surrender encourages us as women to step into our full, authentic, freely expressed sexual selves.</p>

Mona Lisa's Smile,"Do you actually enjoy sex or want to? Are you ready to own your sexuality? Reclaim it, heal it and celebrate it? Women need a safe space in which to heal, explore, examine and learn about their sexuality. This is a group for women to talk openly and freely about women's sexuality, sexual exploration, shaking up the social norms, and ignoring social taboos. So much of our popular culture is built on the idea that sex is for men. That men are the pursuers of sex, and women are the prize to be had. That women only ""give up"" sex to men in exchange for love and commitment, and that women who give it up too easily are, at best, fools who don't know how to broker good deals for ourselves. The idea of women as the sexual gatekeepers, the natural wielders of ""no,"" is so strongly embedded in our culture that women who enthusiastically say ""yes!"" because we actually like sex are profoundly threatening."

<p><span>We believe in showing up as you are, that </span><a>play</a><span> isn't just for kids, that we all still have a lot to learn, that when we move - we can move mountains, that it really does take a village, and that nothing can replace the feeling of connecting with women who&nbsp;really see </span><span>you</span><span>.</span><br></p>
<p><span>Note: If you do not have a profile picture or are a male (sorry, this group is just for the gals), you will be removed. It's all love and our goal is to cultivate a culture of safety. Thank you for understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>"
Create The Life and Business You Love,"<p>Create the life and business you really love. Inspiring heart centred professionals to stand up and shine. No more stressed out, burned out, bored or brain dead. <br></p>
<p>As a coach, and meditation instructor who has given thousands of 1-on-1 sessions to private clients and run many groups around the world, I find that many professionals that I work with, have anxiety about going out alone, they need to define their authentic leadership role, and they have difficulty trusting they are choosing the right path for them.</p>

<p>In our culture, we are conditioned and programmed from birth with the script of the dominators of our culture. In this community we bond, grow, learn, unlearn, celebrate life. As a result of our conditioning from our society and our biological families, we act in ways and create a life that is counter to our own and our collective benefit. Through presentations, instruction, practices, video, creative expression, group exercises, healing practices, love, play, and emotion in safe created space, we will allow our spirit, our soul, our minds and our physical body to return to our essential state (to our essence) in connection to all (rather than in isolation).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we speak of personal growth we are creating a life that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - More and more Conscious<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Living a life toward Meaning<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - being Considerate of the effects our thoughts, emotions, choices and actions have on ourselves, others, the world<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Acknowledging the connection between ourselves and everything everyone and everything that appears not us<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are a group of women committed to taking an intentional journey of growth together, waking up, bonding, learning to love, making deep connection, real community, calling on one another, celebrating together and becoming a community.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Community Home is ""Demeter's Magical Sanctuary"": Healing rooms, educational center, nature retreat, holistic and spiritual lifestyle learning, community.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This community is for all those who self define as women.

Goddess Painting Class,"Paint your OWN sacred icon of the Divine Feminine, *even if you've NEVER painted before!* This class is a supportive, welcoming environment for artists and NON-artists alike to paint the Goddess in her many forms. Led by Katie Ketchum and Jennifer Mantle and based on Shiloh Sophia's Color of Woman method, we gather once a month to feed your spirit and guide you through creating a personal icon from beginning to end. The Color of Woman method was developed by Shiloh to enable you to create a painting you love without any prior knowledge or skill. Jennifer and Katie both thought they could never paint- and now not only teach but have had solo shows of their own work and routinely sell paintings! Classes take place in sacred space and begin with an opening and connecting to the Goddess we are working with that month, and then step-by-step instruction with live demo. This is a criticism-free zone. We are all about empowering and supporting each participant. Open to all, including men, GNC folks, kids, everyone. We also maintain an optional, private Facebook group that you're welcome to join upon taking a class. We would love to see you! Everything included in the class fee of $35, though if you wish to use a larger canvas than those we provide (which are typically around 9"" x 11"") and any favorite paints/brushes, feel free to do so. Kindly avoid the use of scented products."

<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

This group has improved not only my life but so many of us because we surround ourselves with positivity! We officially launched the Palo Alto/Los Altos chapter back in March and after just a few short months we are now over 60 members strong in this chapter and meeting twice a month! Currently we meet at Breathe Holistic Health center (a members space) from 11:30am-1:30pm 2x a month. Registration is required and last minute cancellations heavily frowned upon.

San Francisco Wine Lovers Group,"<p><span>This group is for the general public to enjoy wine and socialize. Whatever wine you like is OK here, because this group is not for the wine industry or the ""wine expert"" snobs. The organizer is not part of the wine industry and does not take money or gifts from the wine industry, e.g., no web site sponsors. Therefor, we don't promote or push any wine brands on our web site.</span></p>

The Walnut Creek Area Dining Out & Social Group,"Hi there!

The Walnut Creek Area Dining Out Meetup is about a few things:

1. People. We're all social people who enjoy making new freinds and having a good time and that's the first goal of our meetups. 
2. Good food. Whether it be an exciting new restaurant, ethnic food, high-end or a cheap-eat, or simply an easy favorite, this group is about enjoying food.  If there's a place you love, send a suggestion and we'll get it on the schedule!
3. Expand our world - whether through food, or people or through the mere act of getting out and doing something you might not normally do, getting together with a group of new people and getting to know each other is expanding your life beyond it's current place.  
4. Fun!  Most importantly, we're here to have fun.  This is an easy, pressure free way to have a good time relax, socialize, party, indulge... it's whatever we make it.

We'll aim for Thurs/Fri/Saturday meetups, but we're also going to have weekday meetups as well.

In addition, we won't always be having full ""dinner"" meetups.  Let's be honest - some of us enjoy a good plate of nachos over a couple of beers and cocktails.  Check our the calendar and see what's coming up!"

Sometime, we have live music events or do anything that is fun with reasonable price events, and some events are ""free""! Life is tough as it's, we're here to laugh and have fun!</p>"
Let's hike and maybe take a break if we get tired,"<p>This group is for all ages.<br /><br />Hike anywhere around the Bay Area (from San Francisco to Santa Barbara).<br /><br />We offer local hikes that meet on the weekends. These hikes are generally from 6-8 miles and easy to moderate. Some of our hikes will be longer.</p>
<p><span style=""color : #800000""><strong>FOR THIS GROUP ONLY: We will plan longer hikes(10-15 miles) and backpacking, camping, ATV.....more</strong></span><br /><br />Members are encouraged to have social events for the group as well.

If you have to change from a ""YES"" to a ""NO"", please don't explain why you can't (we understand you have better thing to do :) or simply just can't make it).

Social Lounge - LGBT,"<p>Welcome to the Social Lounge! We are an inclusive group for lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender. We are diverse in ages, gender &amp; ethnicity.</p>
<p>This group will meet a few times a month. Whether it is a dinner, bbq's, literary night or a hike. We try to be eclectic with the events we choose, so everyone may have an opportunity to attend a meetup that is interesting for them. Additionally, a photo of yourself is requested, however we also understand your need for privacy or ""not being out"" and a picture of your pet or something else is perfectly fine!

North Bay Sailing Meetup Group,"<p>It's easy to make sailing friends here! &nbsp;We are the original sailing Meetup group in the Bay Area, and the largest and most active. &nbsp;We try to offer inexpensive sailing opportunities for everyone. &nbsp; All of our events are free, unlike other groups, which exist to charge people to sail. &nbsp;The only time we charge people is when the event is a charter-share and everyone ""chips in"" on the cost to charter the boat. &nbsp;We don't believe in using the Meetup platform to run a business.</p>
<p>You don't have to know how to sail to be part of the group. &nbsp;People with boats usually always welcome guests aboard to help pull ropes and turn cranks and pass out beer. &nbsp;That is called ""crewing"".</p>
<p>The purpose of this meetup group is to promote and share the passions of sailing. Anyone interested in sailing may join. The variety of scheduled events can help build up your sailing social circle, which is one of the keys to more sailing. Educational, social, and actual sailing events will be fun and allow members to meet each other.</p>
<p>Here is a great little example of some fast sailing and what one of our events is like:&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtu.be/sZGAHo9X54E"">Click here</a></p>
<p>Hopefully we can introduce some passion-sailors to racing. It's a good way to sail more and really learn how to sail well. And it's a great excuse to go sailing on the race days, of which there are quite a lot in SF Bay. And, don't forget practice sessions, too. Crewing for race boats is the best way to get a lot of fun, inexpensive, thrilling sailing with a dedicated crew.</p>
<p><span>Please note that members with 3 ""No Show""s to events will be removed from the group.</span></p>
<p><span>If you no-show to an actual sailing event, or prevent others from sailing if you change your RSVP to no within 48 hours of a sailing event, you could be removed from the group..</span></p>
<p><span>Please update your RSVP in time so the boat owners and captains can plan accordingly. This is a little courtesy to your fellow meetup members to make planning easier and not waste limited seats on a boat.</span></p>"

<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""Where?""</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""When?""</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">We started with this site back in 2007, and in 2010 we had a boom! Since then, the scene has steadily expanded, with many new venues and studios. The old directory became difficult to use and lacked the capacity to incorporate studio classes and special events. In April 2011, I created BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC to better meet these needs. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""Why?""</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">Because I love to dance salsa... and so do you. In short all tropical and regional music will be featured here.</span></span></p>

<p><b><span>Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley &amp; Alameda.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. <strong><span>99 out of every 100 doctors say ""JOIN THIS GROUP!""</span></strong></span></b></p>

Oakland Pathways Volunteers,"<p><strong><span>We hope to fill Oakland's need to improve the city's many hidden pathways/stairways. At first we will remove the plant growth that is harming the pathways. Later we can do other things to improve them by such things as planting flowering plants. It is time to get local people together to improve Oakland.</span></strong></p> 
<p><span>We have already done 15 group weed cleanups which greatly improved 3 pathway/stairways in Oakland's Lakeshore Neighborhood plus one in the Upper Rockridge Neighborhood.</span></p> 
<p><span>We did our first improvement to a pathway in Oakland on Sunday, May 20, 2012, and it was a success. 3 of our group showed up to work on our first pathway which was between Balfour &amp; Calmar. Then a close neighbor we did not know saw us and joined us in removing the weeds. Our team of 4 did a great job as you may see in our photos. Since then some of our cleanups have had as many as 7 people.</span></p>

<p>If you do not know your NTPR tennis skill level here are the guidelines. It will be important in helping you get situated with players of similar levels:</p>
<p>Determine your tennis rating using National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP) categories. The U.S. Tennis Association developed the NTRP rating system and it is the most accurate rating system available. Player levels are based on a scale from 1.0 to 7.0, but our divisions are based on levels from 2.0 - 5.0.</p>
<p>1.0 This player is just starting to play tennis.1.5 Has limited experience and is still working primarily on getting the ball into play.</p>
<p>2.0 Needs on-court experience. Has obvious stroke weaknesses but is familiar with basic positions for singles and doubles play.2.5 Learning to judge where the ball is going although court coverage is weak. Can sustain a short rally of slow pace with other players of the same ability.</p>
<p>3.0 Fairly consistent when hitting medium-paced shots, but is not comfortable with all strokes and lacks execution when trying for directional control, depth or power. Most common doubles formation is one-up and one-back.3.5 Has achieved improved stroke dependability with directional control on moderate shots, but still lacks depth and variety. Starting to exhibit more aggressive net play, has improved court coverage and is developing teamwork in doubles.</p>
<p>4.0 Has dependable strokes, including directional control and depth on both forehand and backhand sides on moderate shots, plus the ability to use lobs, overheads, approach shots and volleys with some success. Occasionally forces errors when serving and teamwork in doubles is evident. Rallies may be lost due to impatience.4.5 Starting to master the use of power and spins and beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents. Can hit first serves with power and accuracy and place the second serve. Tends to overhit on difficult shots. Aggressive net play is common in doubles.</p>
<p>5.0 Has good shot anticipation and frequently has an outstanding shot or exceptional consistency around which a game may be structured. Can regularly hit winners or force errors off of short balls and can put away volleys, can successfully execute lobs, drop shots, half volleys and overhead smashes and has good depth and spin on most second serves.5.5 Has developed power and/or consistency as a major weapon. Can vary strategies and styles of play in a competitive situation and hit dependable shots in a stress situation.</p>
<p>6.0 Generally do not need NTRP ratings. Rankings or past rankings will speak for themselves. The 6.0 player has obtained a sectional and /or national ranking.6.5 The 6.5 player has extensive satellite tournament experience.7.0 The 7.0 player makes his living from tournament prize money.Courtesy NTPR</p>

Sacramento Area Golfers,"<p><span>Welcome to the Sacramento Area Golfers (SAG). We are a group of intermediate to advanced golfers who enjoy participating in golfing events in and around the Sacramento area. We usually play 18 holes but on occasion&nbsp;will play a 9 hole course after work, or join group practice sessions to build on our golfing skills. &nbsp;We try to follow USGA guidelines to the best of our abilities.&nbsp; The bottom line is, we just want to golf, enjoy each other's company, and have fun!&nbsp; Oh ...but we DO try to observe the basics of golfing etiquette.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>In order to play&nbsp;an 18 hole course with SAG, you should be able to consistently hit a minimum of 115 yards from the tee box, make each hole within twice the number of par strokes, and have an average score below 110. &nbsp;If you're score is closer to 115-130 you will need to increase your skill level before playing 18 holes with SAG.&nbsp; <br><span> <br>Please know the basic rules of golf and golf etiquette before you play with our group. &nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>Being focused on your ""Pace of Play"", playing ""Ready Golf"", and adhering to golf etiquette are very important concepts in our group. Less experienced golfers can play well with more experienced golfers when these rules are followed. <br> <br>Please be aware of our RSVP cancellation policy: &nbsp;any RSVP cancellation within 24 hours of an event, for any reason, is considered a ""No-Show"". &nbsp;Members will be expected to pay SAG for their green fee for all cancellations within 24 hours. &nbsp;Members are removed from SAG after three ""no-Shows"". &nbsp; Please be sure you review our cancellation policy statement: &nbsp;<b><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/sacareagolfers/messages/boards/thread/48650056#127610297"">http://www.meetup.com/sacareagolfers/messages/boards/thread/48650056#127610297</a> <br> <br>Whether you participate in our golf outings or our non-golf social events, you are responsible for any damages or injuries you cause to property or other persons. &nbsp;You are participating at SAG events at your own risk, and neither the Organizer nor the Event Organizers will be liable for damages or injuries caused by any of our members (or their guests) during our meetups or travel to and from our meetups. &nbsp;SAG is also not liable for any injuries inflicted upon it members or damages done to members' properties or loss of properties (including golf equipment, transportation, etc.) during events and travel to and from our meetups. &nbsp;SAG members are responsible for reimburing SAG for any incurred costs associated with your event cancellation. <br> <br></b> <br>Join us for local golf deals, coupons and other club news at: <br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/sacareagolfers"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/sacareagolfers</a> <br> <br></p>"

The Oakland/East Bay Happy Hour,"<p><strong>Welcome to Oakland Happy Hour.</strong></p>
<p>We meet&nbsp;most Thursday evenings and&nbsp;visit a different clubs, bars and pubs, near BART, and in Oakland. Our target age range is 30's and 40's.</p>
<p>However.....</p>
<ul> 
 <p>we do also travel to other Bay Area locations in the East Bay like Berkeley and Alameda.</p> 
 <p>We sometimes have social events having nothing to do with happy hour.</p> 
 <p>We also occasionally have events on other days of the week, and</p> 
 <p>we do allow people of all ages to join.</p> 
</ul>
<p>We're kind of free flowing like that with very little structure and very few rules. This is meant to be a fun relaxed atmosphere. There are none of the following:</p>
<ul> 
 <p>No membership dues,</p> 
 <p>No name tags,</p> 
 <p>No opportunists with sales pitches,</p> 
 <p>No a person taking role with a clip board and</p> 
 <p>No giant banners or signs.</p> 
</ul>
<p>We're just there to meet and have fun. It is not necessary to arrive on time for our events; arrive when you can. We do ask that you please RSVP if you might be attending so that we can alert the bar as to how many people to expect to be there and so I can try to negotiate specials with future venues. <span><strong>Our numbers are our discounts</strong></span> and the Oakland Happy Hour is all about discounts when we can get them.</p>
<p>Please be clear, <em><b>we are not a singles meetup</b></em>. This group is about meeting new friends and having a good time. Although I do know that people have started dating after meeting in this group, <b><i>please do not come with the expectation of ""hooking-up.""</i></b> If I get enough complaints, cougars and cheese-balls will be booted.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we have no signage. Please try to look for the Organizer on your first visit. We <span>never</span> put up a sign but are always easy to find with very little effort. you just have to ask. I have found that people in this group are incredibly friendly and very easy to talk to. You just have to show up and order a drink.</p>
<p>Occasionally an organizer tip box may come out to help pay for the website maintenance. Please feel free to contribute only if you had a good time and it will not impede the purchase of your next drink.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

The Bay Area Sushi & Sake Aficionado Group,"<p>Meet other sushi and sake addicts in your area! We'll try different sushi places around the peninsula, attack the fish, drink up some sake, and then rattle our blah blah of what we think about the restaurant - or life in general....</p>
<p>The event limit is 15 people (occasionally more if venue capacity allows), depending on the place, we might have to sit in separate tables (hardly any sushi place can accommodate 15 people in one table). We order a few things and share with our table mates. I will split the check (whatever remaining balance beyond the prepaid fee), divide the food + tax + tips equally and clean up your wallet. Drinks will be paid separately to be fair for those who don't drink but still would like to get fishy.</p>
<p>I am taking the group on average 3-5 times a month cruising up and down from San Jose to San Francisco, coast to inland from the Peninsula to East Bay, to explore legendary sushi and sake spots, hidden gems, and unexpected findings. This is for some serious and adventurous sushi fanatics, needless to say ""California Roll"" and ""Cream Cheese"" are not in our vocabularies, although we'd welcome some eccentric blends. Join this Meetup if you fit the profile ;-)</p>

Sample club projects include providing minority women with routine medical care, funding domestic violence shelters, sponsoring career development programs for teen mothers, and tutoring women in literacy and basic job skills.

Southbay Friends: Boardgames & More,"<p>This group has many types of activities: Boardgames, Karaoke, Hikes, Dance, Theatre Outings, Sport Events, Metaphysical (Meditation, Tantric Learning, Reiki, Massage, etc.), Poker, Sharing Cooking &amp; Baking, Movie Night, Improv Night, and Anything else you suggest.</p>
<p><span><strong>Really! Suggest something!</strong></span></p>
<p>And when it comes to Board Games...I am often asked ""<strong>What kind of Games do you play?</strong>"" <br> A pretty accurate answer to ""What kind of board games do we play"" is: <br> <span><strong>""Euro-Strategy games, as found on BoardGamesGeek.com.""</strong></span></p>
<p>That is not necessarily the most helpful answer, tho.&nbsp; The actual range of games vary from super-simple (learn in 5 minutes, play in 10 minutes) to very involved (learn in 45 minutes, play in 4 hours, takes a dozen games before you really ""get it"")...So, chances are if you think to yourself ""I like playing board games""...you'll probably find someone here who likes what you like :-)</p>
<p><span><strong>***Check our Calendar!***</strong></span></p>
<p>There's so many events per month, it's the only way to know what's coming up! We're all busy professionals, normal people, who want to make the most of our time away from work. We want to do more with our evenings than just sip a drink and check out the cuties in a bar. We want to take a break from trying to hook-up and just have fun together. Since we're not focused on trying to hook-up, single people and coupled people and even N-tupled people can freely join in and we'll all enjoy greater fun.</p>
<p>Many Events are in private home venues, for a very relaxed and comfortable interaction. These events include food, drink, and always interesting people.</p>
<p>If you have an interesting event you'd like to run or host, please contact me (Paul++) and we'll find a way for you to run an event.</p>"

The Diablo Valley Boardgames Meetup,"<p><strong>Do you want to play more board games and meet some awesome people?</strong></p>
<p>Meet nearby Board Game Players! Board Games are making a comeback! Come to the Diablo Valley Boardgames Meetup to enjoy spending time from a full range of games from lighthearted Telephone Pictionary to intense mind burners like Neuland to traditional war gaming. This group is primarily to draw attention to organized events at game stores in which the many dozens of Risk-Like Games are also featured.&nbsp; Risk was originally published in 1957, but currently published by Hasbro.&nbsp; It is not just a game, but a way of playing. A perfectly balanced mix of strategy and luck that generated hundreds of titles around the world. Some are official versions of the original one, others are a development of the basic concept. While this group features Risk Like, it is dedicated to promote the knowledge of all board games and to gather their fans.</p>
<p>Risk like Games and other resources are featured here:<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Risk-like-games/1473010806275339?sk=info&amp;tab=page_info""> <br></a></p>

Take a hike!,"<p><strong>Welcome</strong>!</p>

Children are welcome if they can keep up and sometimes dogs are welcome depending on local regulations. See the ""Photos"" section for pictures of past hikes.</p>

Classic Literature and Cafes Book Club,"<p>I'm hoping to combine two things that I love: Literature and discussion about literature that takes place in a relaxed cafe atmosphere (nothing too fancy here &amp; drinking is optional). A nice way to meet other literature lovers and smart conversationalists.</p>
<p>Come and join the fun and expand your horizons a bit when it comes to literature! I need motivation at times to complete my reading list and maybe you do too? I'm a fan of classic literature (think Aeschylus, Dostoyevsky, Mann, Balzac, Cervantes, Goethe, Hardy, Faulkner) who has a special fondness for modernist and postmodernist writing (e.g., Brautigan, Broch, Breton, Celine, Kundera, Joyce, Rilke, Woolf, Zamyatin, Pynchon, Acker, Cortazar, Ellison, Pamuk, Calvino, Kluge, Garcia-Marquez). If you, like me, are also a fan of thought-provoking foreign/experimental 'art' cinema, you should check out my Radical Visions Cinema Club: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/radical-visions-cinema"">http://www.meetup.com/radical-visions-cinema</a></p>"
Oakland Sailing Meetup Group,"<p>Meet Sailors, from salty souls to those who have never tried it, join us and go sailing. Our group often includes folks from our sponsors school of folks that just finished or are taking classes getting ready to enjoy this combination of sport &amp; lifestyle. Don't be fooled by the number of sailors signed up for the events. The actual number going is ofter much higher.</p>
<p>Oakland Sailing Meetup Group (OSMG) welcomes all (and kids can go, half price or free when adult attendance covers the minimum for renting the boat(s) we use).</p>
<p>We sail for the fun and love of sailing and to just practice. Our fun/practice outings include: sunset sails, casual sailing, Bay cruises, loops around an island, sail to SF city front. Try a sail to an island raft-up or a photography sailing tour of San Francisco Bay. We often enjoy great foody pot-luck BBQs either at Afterguard's site or on a raft-up of boats.</p>
<p>Want to GO SAILING - It is easy to get aboard a boat with OSMG - there are lots of boats. Our primary sponsor is a professional sailing school with a foundation arm that links to the Sea Scouts, Vets and many ages of kids plus Meetup. This is why our Meetup has access to many boats. We do pay to use the boats, but way less than the cost for privately owned yachts placed in charter.</p>
<p>Event cuts offs are set as close to the sailing event as possible. If at the last minute. turns out you can go - just call the posted numbers. Won't check email if close to ""cast off"" point. You don't want to miss the boat.</p>
<p>Members: If you have an idea for a sail or group event - email it in. This is your group too.</p>
<p>April-October 6-8:30 pm we sail every Wed. Some years we host wine or beer tasting and foodie events to follow sailing. In Nov-Mar is when there are more raft ups on weekends and other kinds of sails that follow with the many holidays.</p>
<p>Want to learn to sail? We meet at Afterguard Sailing Academy - the Bay Area's most affordable professional sailing school - the little school with heart. As a school Afterguard does specialize in setting up classes for friends, couples and families on the same boat. Sounds like 'Dah' yet many professional schools force families or couple to separate to different boats to learn. Sailing for Afterguard is a shared sport - learning how to share sailing, as a family, friend, couples, family or co-workers can help to get things done. Afterguard enjoys the reputation as the school that provides the best sailing education for your money. See the sponsor tab to learn more about Afterguard.</p>
<p>Oakland Sailing Meetup Group started in 2008. We are still sailing and loving it.</p>"

The Indian Thing - Revamped!!,"<p>The Indian Thing!! - Is a group for women in their 20s and 30s interested in Indian Culture. In this group we will do all things fun from Indian Culture as well as rest of the world.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this group is to encourage members to share with the rest of the group what they find most interesting and would love to do it with this group - Restaurants, Cafes, Plays, Concerts, Hiking trails, Cultural festivals, all those <span>hole-in-the-wall places you love to go</span> - Just make it into an event with this group. If you need help hosting this event you can ask others to help organize it with you.</p>
<p>Come join this group if you love to meet new people and enjoy doing new things. This is a place where we can form lasting friendships and above all share a good laugh.</p>
<p>RULES, RULES, RULES: Yes we need them :)</p>
<p>The success of the group depends on the joint efforts of its members. Below are some pointers to help us achieve the same:</p>
<p>i) Please be courteous to the event planners time and efforts, if you cannot make it to the event change yours RSVP from YES to NO, ahead of time. This allows other members to join the event.</p>
<p>ii) If you have RSVPed 'YES' for an event have 3 'No Shows' in a 365 day period, you will be removed from the group. Changing the RSVP from YES to NO in last 4 hour period of the event will be considered 'No Show'.</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to come, do not hesitate to let the organizers/event host know.</p>
<p>iv) We do understand your privacy concerns but do try to post a legitimate picture on your profile, especially if you are hosting an event. This helps other members to recognize you.</p>
<p>v) New applicants who do not have profile description or photo would not be accepted to the group, it is difficult to know if you are joining this group for legitimate reasons without that information.</p>
<p><span>vi) Lastly but most importantly:</span></p>
<p>If you are organizing an event through some other sources please do not make it an event on this meetup. This meetup is only for organizing events that you want to attend with members of this group. No promotional event please. Those events will be removed.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: <br> <br> The organizer reserves the right to say No. This group assumes ABSOLUTELY NO responsibility, including but not limited to injury or loss of any kind/form due to the use of information, or participating in activities found on this group/site.

SpreadKindness.org,"<p>This group is for people who believe in practicing acts of kindness in everyday life. If we can get more people doing this then the world will become a happier place where peace and joy happen.</p>
<p>Join us as we inspire, enlighten, and make someone's day happy through sincere kindness of our hearts. Together we can make a world of difference- one person at a time. If you do one random act of kindness everyday it will put a smile on both your face and also on the face of the other person.</p>
<p>Location: This group will travel around the Bay Area to do&nbsp;acts of kindness&nbsp;for people, organizations, and individuals.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: You're likely to feel good and become addicted to practice acts of kindness everyday!</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves. &rdquo;</p>

<p><span>Meet your neighbors, make new friends, and discover all that this beautiful area has to offer. &nbsp;Whether you are new to the area, or you've been here a while and looking to make friends, this group is for you!</span></p>
<p><span>We try to schedule a variety of meetups, and we encourage our active members to suggest meetups as well! If you hear of anything happening nearby, please let us know! Some suggested meetups might be: local concerts/events/fairs, new restaurant openings, happy hours, children's events, walks, crafting, photo walks, geocaching, bowling, karaoke, biking, movie night, beer/wine tasting, dinner parties, holiday parties, picnics, etc. What do YOU like to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Looking forward to meeting you all!</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any questions, concerns, comments or suggestions or just want to talk with me, give me a call or text at 707-567-8779.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, welcome to the Vallejo/Benicia area and to our group!<br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely, Scott and the Vallejo/Benicia Area Newcomers Organizers (VBAN) and Hosts</span></p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p><span>Membership dues are just $5 per year, to cover the fees that Meetup charges us, as well as any additional expenses such as fliers, signs, etc. If you have any trouble with paying online through Meetup, please contact me to arrange an alternate method. The dues for now are voluntary but I hope you'd like to contribute as the cost to meetup.com is almost $200 per year for the organizer and if there is some extra (there hasn't been as of yet) we'd like to put that toward events for those in need or those without perhaps, or maybe advertising or party accessories or games perhaps for the group events/activities.<br> </span></p>
<p><span>If you want to suggest/host a meetup, please follow these guidelines:</span></p>
<p>- You must be an ACTIVE member, and have attended at least TWO events where at least one of the regular VBAN organizers also attended, and we've had a chance to get to know you. This is to ensure everyone's continued FUN and SAFETY! As a general rule, it is not a good idea to email people from the group without their permission, and especially don't make others uncomfortable. Please share your real name (first only is ok) and share a picture of you (not just your animals or a sunset for example) in your profile so we can all have a deeper level of safety. Thank you for your understanding!</p>
<p>- If your suggested event is approved (usually they are!), it will be announced as an official meetup and the rest of the group will automatically be notified. Usually the only reason it would not be approved is if we don't know you yet, or the event conflicts with another proposed event. Again, thank you for your understanding!</p>
<p><span>- This particular group has a lot of people who are new to the area, and quite often are new to the whole ""meetup"" concept itself. So, in your meetup description, state clearly, where and when you will meet, how long you will be in the meeting spot, and how they can find you. Try to think of questions a new person might have, and include that information in your description.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not wish to host the event, and you are just letting people know about something interesting that is happening, include ""No-host event"" in the title.</span></p>
<p><span>- If you ARE hosting an event, please bring a ""meetup"" sign with you that is large enough to be seen clearly, and display it or hold it so that new members can find you easily. You can ""google"" the word ""meetup"" and print out the logo. Usually a half-sheet of cardstock, with the logo printed on the bottom half is good. You can then fold it in half and it will stand up by itself on a table.</span></p>
<p><span>See you soon!</span></p>

SF Bay Sailing Meetup Group,"<p>A place for Skippers and Crew to ""Meetup"" and share a safe, enjoyable day on the water while practicing sailing skills and learning more about boats, sailing and the sea.</p>
<p>And, of course, we are the newest, classiest and best looking sailing meetup group in the Bay Area. ;-)</p>
<p>If you have taken a small boat sailing or basic keel-boat class and would like to get some experience actually working a sailboat on the Bay, then this Meetup group is for you. Don't be offended by being called a Newbie, sharing our love of sailing is what we enjoy most.</p>
<p>While it should not need to be said, please know that everyone is welcome here. Being chosen for an event is completely based on order of sign-up and confirmation. <br></p>
<p>When you sign up for an event, you must be serious about attending. You may not sign up as ""something that you might like to do"" and then decide at the last minute that you would rather do something else. With other Meetup groups this might be totally acceptable. But here if you take a spot, that someone else would have gladly filled, and don't show up, you have deprived someone else of the opportunity to enjoy a day on the Bay - so you will be removed from the group (even if you have paid for the event).</p>
<p>Oh, and if you act creepy, or make other members uncomfortable, you are out, period. No appeal. If you feel that someone is acting inappropriately, please let me (or Meetup) know.</p>
<p>Yes, we charge for most events. If you think that we make a profit, you are bad at math. The small donations towards expenses that you make do not come close to paying the substantial costs involves in operating and maintaining the boats, but they certainly help and they make doing what we do possible. If you bail on an event at the last minute please do not expect a refund, unless we are able to fill your seat.</p>
<p>Always answer the contact information questions when you sign up or you will not be considered and we cannot confirm your reservation.</p>
<p>Lastly, please keep coming back to the site to check and see if you have been selected to attend. If you have been selected you will receive further information on who, what, when and where. But if you have not been selected, you will not be contacted at all. It would be great if we could do this, but it is everything that we can do just to organize the event and keep the attendees informed. Thank you for your understanding on this one.</p>
<p><i>Notice: Please be aware that while the State of California may view possession of Marijuana as legal, the United States Government and the U.S. Coast Guard does not. You may not bring marijuana (or any other illegal drugs) onto our vessels. This is not debatable.</i> <br></p>
<p>Be assured that the Captains that participate in this Meetup Group are Licensed by the United States Coast Guard which involves extensive training and many years of experience. The boats are well maintained and equipped and we all carry commercial insurance. This is very different than all the other groups who do not have licensed Captains, nor the proper insurance (although many of these people do describe themselves as ""Captains""). If anyone asks you for money to attend a sailing event, ask to see their USCG Captain's license.</p>
<p>We put an emphasis on safety here, but we do want you to have an enjoyable time as well. So, please do understand that we will ask you to wear a life jacket (they are brand new and comfortable), but do come ready to have a great time. Thank you. <br></p>

<p><b>FYI - I can provide entertainment</b> for you or your company and/or refer you to actors, entertainers, magicians, jugglers, stilt-walkers, directors, workshop leaders, shows and performances for just about any kind of event and venue. I have a vast network of friends who perform and entertain... if I can't do it, I probably know someone who can!&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I am also a Certified Laughter Yoga Leader - and coach business people and executives in ESL/ Accent Reduction as well as Public Speaking, acting and singing. Feel free to contact me directly at haffrick@gmail.com</b></p>
<p><span>Here's a little about the theatre company whom I have worked with for over 20 years - California Theatre Center (CTC) in Sunnyvale:</span></p>
<p>I served as a company member and Marketing Director here for over 17 years. CTC is a professional, not-for-profit, repertory theatre based at The Sunnyvale Theatre... the company employs a talented and versatile, full-time acting company which performs a rich repertory of hour-long plays for Young Audiences during the traditional school year (all over the West Coast!) and full-length plays for adults and families (CTC Summer Rep) at the The Sunnyvale Community Center on Remington Drive during June and July.</p>
<p>CTC has toured all over the world and has won numerous awards and honors. I got to travel and perform in Fiji, New Zealand and The Cook Islands with CTC! The company also offers an outstanding Education program for children of all ages in several South Bay locations taught by the professional actors in the company. <a href=""http://www.ctcinc.org"">www.ctcinc.org</a></p>"
!The Good Life!............... for people 30ish to 50ish,"<p><strong>We are a social group of people, mostly 30ish to 50ish, who want to, and realize, we live <i>The Good Life!</i></strong></p>
<p>Most events are social in nature. We are open to singles, couples, and in between. We will do activities such as mingling over wine or cocktails and are focused on making friends, or things like dancing, hikes, movies, concerts, lunches, picnics,&nbsp;street fairs, community service projects, workshops, etc. We want to attract people with good social skills that are fun and friendly, young at heart, active, easy going, and adventurous for events in the South Bay, Peninsula, and Greater Bay Area. <br> <br><b> So, if you want to live <i>The Good Life</i>, make more friends, and do fun activities, come join us!!!</b> <br> <br> In trying to keep it fun and friendly, as organizer, I'm very protective of the overall group atmosphere. So, here's a short list of people that should skip our group. <br> 1. Creepy men that are too touchy with women they have just met. <br> 2.&nbsp;<span>People who don't get the concept of friends, and instead are stalkers, players or drama queens.</span> <br> 3. Party crashers, who crash closed RSVP parties making it too crowded. <br> 4. People not interested in friendships, who join just to send spam about their book, band, Amway, etc. <br> <br> All these people get deleted from the group fast.</p>"
Mensa / San Francisco Region,"<p>This MeetUp provides a dynamic way for members of San Francisco Regional Mensa to get the latest on Mensa events in the Bay Area and to more easily host their own Mensa events. The idea is that by eliminating the very long lead time now necessary to post things to the Intelligencer, we will have more, and more varied, events on the calendar.</p>
<p>You <b>MUST </b>be a <b>*current*</b> member of Mensa to join this group. When you click ""Join Us"" (above right), please include your full name AND your Mensa membership number so that we can verify your membership.</p>
<p>If you'd like to become a member of Mensa, please go to the SFRM website, <a href=""http://www.sfmensa.org/"">http://www.sfmensa.org/</a>, to find out how to qualify, or to locate a testing session near you.</p>
<p><b>Organizers and Event Organizers can post events directly to our Meetup site, but Meetup no longer allows non-organizers to post events directly.</b></p>
<p>If you are a member of our Meetup group, but not an organizer, and you wish to have an event posted, click on ""Suggest a new Meetup"", or send an email to membership@sfmensa.org. &nbsp;Be sure and be specific as to what the event is, including a full description, date, time, and location. &nbsp;If you'd like the event to recur on a regular basis (e.g., 3rd Wednesday of the month), be sure to specify that as well.<br></p>

<p>The goal is to enjoy as a social activity in a friendly, supportive, social, non-competitive environment. This group is geared for beginners and people who don't take dancing (or themselves) too seriously.</p>
<p>Making mistakes and not dancing perfectly on the beat is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a beginner is okay.&nbsp; We are not snobs.&nbsp; We want to make going to dance clubs an enjoyable, friendly, social, and personal experience -- not a dance off or a showcase for one's greatness or an exercise in&nbsp;competitive social gamesmanship.</p>

<p>The environment we hold for our discussions is open and compassionate. Recognizing and honoring the different beliefs and political viewpoints, and seeking best to understand and explore. Six principles for dialogue:</p>
<p>6 principles common to most dialogue and circle groups guide the conversations: <br> . Suspend judgment as best you can <br> . Respect one another <br> . Seek to understand rather than persuade <br> . Invite and honor diversity of opinion <br> . Speak what has personal heart and meaning <br> . Go for honesty and depth without going on and on</p>

Happy Hour Club,"<p>Do you like good beer ? Do you appreciate a decent cocktail ? Do you like relaxing after a stressful week day with a chilled out, friendly, crowd ? Do you hate paying full price fer your booze ?</p>
<p>If so then Happy Hour Club for you. Every couple of weeks or so we'll meet up at a different bar in San Francisco, for a drink or two after work. Usually we'll try and hit up a good happy hour to get the most from our recession hit bucks. Though it's more about the socializing than the drinking. To find us look for a meet-up sign.</p>
<p>As always these events are dependent on getting enough people coming to make it worth my while. So hope you can make it!</p>"
Ladies Meet over a Meal,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>There are so many of us out here in the San Francisco and Bay Area; we all have different interests, different backgrounds and skills, as well as different preferences in what we eat.  Since I love eating and figure many others do too, I thought it would be fun to use the lunch hours to bring us all together.  Whether you want to try new restaurants, meet some new, exciting, and different people, or simply just build your connections... I invite you to join us for some of our lunches.  Most lunches would be in restaurants around the downtown, north beach, and financial district area during the weekdays.  Right now, I am looking into Fridays, but feel free to give me suggestions of restaurants or days that may work better for you. <br />Look forward to meeting many of you!</p>

We are a very casual and informal book club, meaning that it's just very relaxed. There is no set outline for our meetings, we just talk! We laugh a lot and have fun! Our meetings usually last about 30 minutes to an hour, but the meeting can go longer for those members who continue to hang out and just talk. We also host events that have nothing to do with books at all! Movies, lunch, theater! We hope that members can build some really great friendships through the group so we try and do a non-book related event every month. To get a better idea of what we're about, please take a moment to read the About Us page (located in the ""Pages"" tab), where you will find more information about how the group operates, a list of books that we have read, and a list of other fun events that we have done.</span></p>
<p>***Disclaimer*** The Roseville Women's Book Club is a casual, informal book club. I usually do not bring discussion questions to the meetings, but members are welcome to bring them if they like. Our meetings are a mixture of discussing the book and socializing with one another. Some discussions/meetings last longer than others and are always intermixed with off topic, social conversation. If you are seeking a more formal book club, with lengthy, in depth, serious discussions, this may not be the book club for you. If you're looking for a book club that is less intimidating and more casual in discussion, then we may be the perfect fit. If you're not sure, please join and try us out.</p>

The sailboats are well built, comfortable, in great condition,&nbsp;and have big canvas dodgers (windshield) and bimini (top) to keep us out of the sun and wind if desired.&nbsp; All vessels carry up to 6 guests plus the Captain. The boat is set-up for single-handed sailing, but everyone is invited to have a turn on the Helm (steering) or help out with the lines and sails (tacking and gybing)!&nbsp; The Capt. is a UCGC credentialed operator 100 Ton vessel &amp; 100 miles offshore - also an ASA Sailing Instructor.&nbsp; Occasionally when the weather isn't great for sailing we utilize the group's limousine for fun, FREE WINE tasting trips to Napa &amp; Sonoma Wine Country, wow!</span></p>"

I'd love to have people who are entrepreneurial at heart and want to meet others who are just passionate about their work as they are about their social life. We'll do more than just meet at social gatherings. I'd also like to setup events in where we can expand our professional network and attend interesting lectures and conferences on topics of interest, whether it's global warming, Web 2.0, micro financing, or the latest art scene to hit the streets, I'd like this to be an eclectic group of people.</p>

The Indian Thing - Revamped!!,"<p>The Indian Thing!! - Is a group for women in their 20s and 30s interested in Indian Culture. In this group we will do all things fun from Indian Culture as well as rest of the world.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this group is to encourage members to share with the rest of the group what they find most interesting and would love to do it with this group - Restaurants, Cafes, Plays, Concerts, Hiking trails, Cultural festivals, all those <span>hole-in-the-wall places you love to go</span> - Just make it into an event with this group. If you need help hosting this event you can ask others to help organize it with you.</p>
<p>Come join this group if you love to meet new people and enjoy doing new things. This is a place where we can form lasting friendships and above all share a good laugh.</p>
<p>RULES, RULES, RULES: Yes we need them :)</p>
<p>The success of the group depends on the joint efforts of its members. Below are some pointers to help us achieve the same:</p>
<p>i) Please be courteous to the event planners time and efforts, if you cannot make it to the event change yours RSVP from YES to NO, ahead of time. This allows other members to join the event.</p>
<p>ii) If you have RSVPed 'YES' for an event have 3 'No Shows' in a 365 day period, you will be removed from the group. Changing the RSVP from YES to NO in last 4 hour period of the event will be considered 'No Show'.</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to come, do not hesitate to let the organizers/event host know.</p>
<p>iv) We do understand your privacy concerns but do try to post a legitimate picture on your profile, especially if you are hosting an event. This helps other members to recognize you.</p>
<p>v) New applicants who do not have profile description or photo would not be accepted to the group, it is difficult to know if you are joining this group for legitimate reasons without that information.</p>
<p><span>vi) Lastly but most importantly:</span></p>
<p>If you are organizing an event through some other sources please do not make it an event on this meetup. This meetup is only for organizing events that you want to attend with members of this group. No promotional event please. Those events will be removed.</p>

Sisters In Arms - Single Moms,"<p>Are you a single mom or pregnant and single?</p>
<p>Join us as we share the joys and struggles of single motherhood!</p>
<p>Single moms have to do it all -- we have to be both the mother AND the father, the nurturer and disciplinarian, teacher, friend and provider. Sometimes, it's hard not to look around at the couples with or without kids and feel like no one understands what you are going through.</p>
<p>Sisters In Arms - Single Moms is a social/support networking community for ""solo moms"" to meet and form close connections with other moms in similar situations. This group encourages social and professional networking, and the sharing/exchange of ideas, tips and experiences with others who understand (and may actually be experiencing many of the same issues as you) in a compassionate, empowering atmosphere. Through our meetups, informal gatherings and friendly discussions, we address ALL topics pertaining to single motherhood (such as child support, raising children of all ages, first-time moms, pregnancy, dating/intimacy and co-parenting with exes, to name a few) -- no topic is EVER taboo! We pride ourselves on the fact that our community is full of supportive, non-judgmental ""Sisters"" who are there for you when you need someone to vent your frustrations to...</p>
<p>As Sisters In Arms, our main goal is to support one another and share in the laughter and fun that may have fallen to the wayside while we were focusing on being ""Super Mom."" We encourage those who may be feeling alone on their journey to attend one of our meetups -- we guarantee that you will walk away from the event with some new found friends!</p>
<p>We have several meetups* and outings scheduled each month, so please check our site/calendar regularly for event details. Although we are primarily based in the South Bay, we do try to schedule meetups all around the Bay Area, to accommodate the locational diversity of our community.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining our group, please read our ""About Us"" page to learn more, and to familiarize yourself with our group policies.</p>
<p>*The majority of our meetups are child and ""framily"" (female friends or family) members friendly. Designated ""Moms Only"" events are open to Sisters and any female friends or family members, and ""Moms &amp; Friends"" events are open to Sisters and male or female friends and family members.</p>
<p>We are now on Facebook! &nbsp;You must be an approved member of this group to be approved for our FB group. &nbsp;You can find us at:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/groups/103012766884313/</p>"
!The Good Life!............... for people 30ish to 50ish,"<p><strong>We are a social group of people, mostly 30ish to 50ish, who want to, and realize, we live <i>The Good Life!</i></strong></p>
<p>Most events are social in nature. We are open to singles, couples, and in between. We will do activities such as mingling over wine or cocktails and are focused on making friends, or things like dancing, hikes, movies, concerts, lunches, picnics,&nbsp;street fairs, community service projects, workshops, etc. We want to attract people with good social skills that are fun and friendly, young at heart, active, easy going, and adventurous for events in the South Bay, Peninsula, and Greater Bay Area. <br> <br><b> So, if you want to live <i>The Good Life</i>, make more friends, and do fun activities, come join us!!!</b> <br> <br> In trying to keep it fun and friendly, as organizer, I'm very protective of the overall group atmosphere. So, here's a short list of people that should skip our group. <br> 1. Creepy men that are too touchy with women they have just met. <br> 2.&nbsp;<span>People who don't get the concept of friends, and instead are stalkers, players or drama queens.</span> <br> 3. Party crashers, who crash closed RSVP parties making it too crowded. <br> 4. People not interested in friendships, who join just to send spam about their book, band, Amway, etc. <br> <br> All these people get deleted from the group fast.</p>"

"I am Happy Project - Roseville, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you.

Milpitas Social Group (MSG),"<p><span><strong>First and foremost,&nbsp;we wanted to create a place where everyone in the <span>Bay Area</span> can meet and make new friends doing something fun.</strong></span> <span><strong> <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>This group is for all ages over 18!!!</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE DO?</strong> We do things around the Bay Area (from <span>San Francisco</span> to Santa Barbara):</p>
<ul> 
 <p><strong>We eat:</strong> dinners, pot lucks, happy hours, parties with food</p> 
 <p><strong>We have fun</strong>:&nbsp;zip lines, paddle boats, beach parties, camping, treat yourself to a massage/spa treatment, holiday parties, monopoly board games, social dances</p> 
 <p><strong>We get fit:</strong> hiking, walking, dancing</p> 
 <p><strong>We improve our relationship potentials:</strong> dating games, meeting new people, practicing our flirting skills, figuring out what we want in potential mates, learning how to attract the right people</p> 
</ul>
<p>We want this group to be a positive and safe place where you can explore your interests and potentials&nbsp;with confidence. For this reason, we are selective. We are only looking for people of high quality: people who are respectful and courteous of others,&nbsp;people who are committed to learning and growing, people who are open-minded and&nbsp;friendly (afterall, socializing means getting along with others, among other things.)</p>
<p><strong>IS THIS GROUP RIGHT FOR ME?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes, if you are:</p>
<ul> 
 <p><strong>Just broke up with a boyfriend/girlfriend?</strong> Well join the group! Struggling with Divorce? Meet other people who are also in the midst of divorce, custody, or support-related issues and need some direction.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tired of the online dating scenes</strong> where you soon realized that&nbsp;eternal texting, chatting, and emailing cannot compare to a real human experience where you actually spend time doing something with someone? Well, we have live and real-time interacting here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Newly singled and are yet unsure what you want to do with your life?</strong> We suggest an experimental period of staying single where you can try a variety of new things, make new friends, gain new attitudes etc... You just need to find what is really right for YOU!</p> 
 <p><strong>Interested in making yourself attractive to potential mates?</strong> Your first mission&nbsp;should be to figure out what makes&nbsp;you happy as a single person and learning to enjoy life to its fullest extent while making plenty of friends out there on the trails, at the dinner parties or our other fun events.</p> 
 <p><strong>Wanting to get out of a rut?</strong> If you picture yourself as always being alone, miserable or whatever then your subconscious will see to it that you do things to keep you that way. BUT,&nbsp;if you can visualize yourself as having fun, being with other people and happier, then your subconscious will work to make positive things happen helping to boost your confidence, increase your potential, and making you the fun, interesting and attractive person that you were meant to be.</p> 
</ul>
<p><span><strong><em>Remember</em>, ""b<em>ecause you are alive, everything is possible!</em>""</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Thich Nhat Hanh</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>DO IT NOW!</strong></span> By signing up, you are telling yourself that there is absolutely no need to be miserable. As most people spend more time planning a weekend than they do planning the rest of their life, you can go against the norm and plan for the rest of your life by spending your weekends with us!</p>

Motherless Daughters - East Bay,"<p>We are a supportive community of women whose mothers have died.</p>
<p>When a daughter loses her mother, she joins an unexpected, undesired ""club.""

To soothe this isolation and other challenges we face on this journey, we get together and share our stories. Through this group, you may also find lasting friendships and support. This group is for any Bay Area motherless daughter needing the support and willing to meet up in the East Bay region.</p>

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Peninsula and South Bay 20's-40's Girls who love books,"<p>Peninsula and South Bay 20's-40's Girls who love books is a meetup group in which we meet at various cafes, bars and restaurants and each other's homes on the Peninsula/in the South Bay to discuss books we love.</p>
<p>This group will have a focus on different types of literature new and old.</p>
<p>The activities of the women in this group are not solely limited to discussing books - we love to try new places to eat and explore. Happy Reading to Everyone!</p>"
Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>"

This group is for anyone who likes to go hiking, or for walks and would like people to go with. If you like walking with other people, if you are shy, friendly, outgoing, or just love being outdoors, this is a chance to hang out with some fun people.</p>
<p>I work for the Open Space Authority and we preserve land for wildlife and people alike. If you want to know more, please check out the web site at www.openspaceauthority.org. This meetup is not actually sponsored by Open Space Authority but will include all kinds of info on their latest hikes since I am in the know. I want you to be in the know too! (smile)</p>"

Midtown Readers,"<p>**If your trial period ended, you were automatically removed from the meetup group. Please feel free to join again!!**</p>
<p><span>Midtown Readers is a book club for women of all ages (sorry, guys!) who seek friendships and share a love of reading a wide range of books. </span><span>Jesa and Rachel have been the organizers since August of 2013 with the intention of making Midtown Readers a space for friendships,&nbsp; community, and intelligent discussion. If you are looking for other spirited women to have thoughtful discussions with, look no further! This is a very friendly group, and new members are always welcome (we do sometimes stray outside the book--just a warning!).</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past year or so, Midtown Readers has grown into a social group that meets three times a month to discuss books (Midtown Readers), watch documentaries (Documentary Night), and make stuff (Midtown Makers). Some of us also meet as part of the Women's March movement (<a href=""https://www.womensmarch.com/100/action2/"">Huddle</a>).&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><b>Midtown Readers </b>meets the 1st Thursday of each month at a coffee shop, restaurant, wine bar, or private residence in (or fairly close to) Midtown. We poll members and ask that they select 3 or 4 books from the poll, and schedule books a few months in advance. Book selections for the polls are taken from members' comments. If you make suggestions after the poll, we'll add it to the next one. Ideal selections are books under 450 pages, and also available in paperback, e-book, and audiobook formats.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>If anyone has a suggestion for a location (preferably not too loud with ample seating), or would like to host, feel free to post in the comments of that event.&nbsp;Also, if you aren't able to finish the book, and don't mind spoilers, come anyway! </p>
<p><b>Midtown Makers </b>is hosted by on the 3rd Thursday at Tupelo. We've got members who knit, quilt, color, bullet journal, crochet, hand spin, sew...basically, if it's portable, bring it. Newbies and experienced makers are welcome! We have members who do most of the above and we are happy to teach if you'd like to learn. Send Rachel a message if you need supplies to borrow for the night. <br></p>
<p><span><b>Movie Nights </b>are hosted in various members' homes on the 4th Thursday, where we watch a documentary (or something topical), drink wine and eat snacks while watching and discussing the movie. This is generally on the 4th Thursday of the month, unless our host needs to make a change.</span></p>
<p><span>As of April 2016, we're asking members to pay $10 per billing cycle (6-months). New members have the option of trying Midtown Readers for two months and paying $10 if they like the group and want to join after that ""trial"" period.&nbsp; We pay up to $180 in Meetup fees yearly, and if we find that $10 (minus fees) covers us for a full year or more, we will adjust the payment plan. Currently, excess funds will be donated to WEAVE and Sacramento Library Adult Literacy Program by the next billing cycle (August). If you have concerns, please feel free to message us about them.&nbsp; <br></span></p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you soon! <br></p>

Social Fluency,"<p>My name is Barbara Hyman, and I'm an author, teacher, and healer. I've been on the Spiritual Path for awhile, by virtue of my advanced age. (Pushing 60!). That makes me sound a lot older than I feel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel young because every day I connect with my Spiritual path, and my love, which is the energetic frequency and vibration of communication and manifestation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I teach about, and what my upcoming book, Deliberate Trust, A Guide to Intentional Manifestation is all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when you're speaking about communication, in my book, you're speaking about love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when you're speaking about improving communication, in my book, you're speaking about personal growth, and spiritual evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I hope we can meet, and make a difference in eachothers' lives!</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest and participation in this powerful conversation about living in harmony with other Human Beings.&nbsp;</p>"

"I am happy project - Davis, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you. Visit http://iamhappyproject.org for more information; while you are there please follow us on twitter and like us on Facebook.</p>"

30's to 40's Santa Cruz Girlfriends' Club,"<p>&nbsp;I've lived in Santa Cruz off and on for over seven years as a thirty something and now a forty something, and found that it can be rather challenging to meet other ladies of the same age who like to get out and have some fun! This group is to provide a safe, comfortable space for like minded women to get together and chat, laugh, bond, and just be girls-- while possibly discovering a new restaurant, cafe, wine bar, beach, or local fun event that you didn't even know existed! &nbsp;We have also had numerous, very successful game-nights! &nbsp;I also strongly encourage all of our members to suggest new meetups -- your fresh ideas and energy are what will keep this group alive and intereresting! &nbsp;In order to join the group you need to have an actual picture of yourself on your meetup profile, so that we'll know who to look for at our events. &nbsp;As a friendly reminder this group is NOT for networking, selling, or info gathering--only for women who are sincerely interested in making some new friends. &nbsp;</p>"

Ultimate Football Walnut Creek (UFWC),"<p>We've&nbsp;been playing UF&nbsp;since&nbsp;November 1st,&nbsp;2009 and recently completed our&nbsp;500th game.&nbsp; UF is a team oriented, competitive and fast paced game for adults and older kids. We play most weekends&nbsp;and occasional evening games mid-week.&nbsp;Games are capped at 26 players.&nbsp; Occasionally, we run a tournaments.</p>
<p> UF is not a league; there is no commitment&nbsp;to play.&nbsp; If you decide to play, you simply confirm when you can and then show up.&nbsp; It's a great workout and a fun time with friends. Sportsmanship, teamwork and fair play are the most critical components of UF and a must for anyone who decides to compete.&nbsp; We have a code of conduct and we're serious about it. </p>
<p>For night games, we charge $5 to cover the fees for the lights and any additional money goes to our charitable efforts.&nbsp; Once a month, we'll have a GRATEFUL GAME where players are asked to contribut $5 each for charity.</p>
<p> In 2014, we raised&nbsp;just over&nbsp;$7,100 to help the Lazarex Cancer Foundation (<a href=""http://www.lazarex.org"">www.lazarex.org</a>).&nbsp; That money was raised through optional player donations.&nbsp; In 2015, we raised $2,500 and provided 112 ($5,000) worth of microloans across the world through <a href=""http://www.kiva.org"">www.kiva.org</a>.&nbsp; In 2016, we donated $2,750 to the City of Hope, $3,000 to Heifer International (6 cows), $875 to a local science teacher, $875 to Contra Costa Group Homes and $875 to Groceries for Seniors in San Francisco.&nbsp; In 2017 we have devoted over $4,300 to one of our own struggling with a serious illness.&nbsp; In 2018.....</p>

Sacramento Sea Kayakers,"<p><span><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We Do:</strong></span></p>
<p>Sacramento Sea Kayakers is a&nbsp;<span><strong>non-profit organization&nbsp;that is organized collectively by its members.</strong></span> Members range from beginners to professionals, and own all types of paddling craft. We paddle all types of bodies of water including lakes, rivers, bays, and ocean. Recreational kayaks and entry level skills are sufficient for many of the club's events, but some events necessitate specific skills and equipment. Our paddles offer lots of fun practice opportunities for ""new to paddling"" and intermediate flat water paddlers. Motivated kayakers will find ample opportunities to ramp up their skills through our skill clinics and advanced paddles, <span>which when combined with some formal training, and lots of fun practice will help paddlers transition into being comfortable on the bay and ocean.</span></p>
<p><span>All dues and fees received are used to pay for things as determined by the Members, such as free or reduced camping, meals, skills clinics, classes and parties, etc.</span> We avoid commercial or political interests, but&nbsp;to enhance the sport of kayaking we do&nbsp;make some exceptions.</p>
<p><strong><span>Mission Statement:</span></strong></p>
<p>Sacramento Sea Kayakers Paddling Club (SSKPC / SSK) promotes kayaking in a safe and responsible manner, while making new friendships with a common interest. We kayak year round and encourage paddlers to expand their skills through training with professional&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.americancanoe.org/"">ACA</a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bcu.org.uk/"">BCU</a> instructors, and joining us on our paddles to practice and refine those skills.</p>
<p><span><strong>Monthly Public Meetings:</strong></span></p>
<p>The club has Monthly Educational Meetings that are open to the public. These usually occur the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 6p.m. at a location posted on the Meet-up site. These meetings provide great opportunities for paddlers (club members and the public alike) to socialize and learn more about kayaking. These meetings are also a great way for new and prospective members to learn about the club and meet other members.</p>
<p><span><strong>Joining Sacramento Sea Kayakers:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Membership Requirements</span></strong></p>

<p><span><strong>Event Organizers /</strong></span> <strong><span><span>Trip Initiators Are Not Guides:</span> <br> </span></strong></p>
<p>Although Meetup uses the term ""Event Organizer"", Sacramento Sea Kayakers prefers the term ""Trip Initiator"".&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacramento Sea Kayakers does cooperative, non-guided, trips.&nbsp;Trip initiators are no more responsible for the safety of others than anyone else in the group.&nbsp; If you need or desire a guide, hire a professional through a commercial outfitter.</p>
<p>Each and every meetup participant is responsible for his/her own safety.&nbsp; Use your own judgement.&nbsp; Never blindly follow anyone into a situation you are unsure about.</p>
<p>On trips be prepared to take care of yourself.&nbsp; This does not mean that the other members of the group won't assist anyone who needs it, but such assistance should never be taken for granted, especially in difficult conditions. Be aware that, despite all good intentions, there is always a real possibility of being separated from the group.&nbsp; It is up to each and every participant to know the trip agenda.&nbsp; Approach each trip as if you were initiating and planning it yourself.&nbsp; Trip initiators are members of the club just like everyone else.&nbsp; Some may have more experience than you, while others may not.&nbsp; They are not professionals; don't be over-reliant on them.</p>
<p>Although trip initiators are not responsible for evaluating participants' kayaking abilities, they&nbsp; have the right to eliminate anyone who they feel is not prepared with the adequate skills or equipment for a particular trip.&nbsp; Trip initiators can organize (or not organize) the trip any way he or she wants.&nbsp;<strong>Get to know your trip initiator(s) and feel free to talk to him/her beforehand to find out how the trip is to be structured.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Becoming an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator</strong></span></p>
<p>Any MEMBER who follows SSK Trip Initiator Guidelines (which are contained within the below form) is eligible to be an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator.&nbsp; If you would like to plan and post trips for our club,&nbsp;<span><strong>you are encouraged to complete the&nbsp;<span><a href=""http://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/s8w549R575xt"">SSK Trip Initiator Guidelines</a></span></strong> <span><strong>form!</strong></span></span> We want as many Members as possible to initiate trips.</p>"
Silicon Valley Women in Technology,"<p>I recently attended my first conference for women in technology (the Grace Hopper Celebration) and was blown away by how exciting it was to be surrounded by so many smart, awesome women in tech. Join up if you want that experience (on a smaller scale, of course) here in Silicon Valley!</p>
<p>I'm picturing this as a group where we can get together socially and meet other women who share our passion for computers and technology. We could also meet up at events like She's Geeky or attend tech seminars.</p>"
San Francisco International Women,"<p><span>Did you move solo to San Francisco for work? Or maybe you followed your partner to Silicon Valley? Or perhaps you're an American who has spent considerable time living internationally?</span><br></p>
<p>This is a group for international women who <span>moved to the US</span> for their partner's or their own work, or American women who have spent time living abroad, and are looking for likeminded friends.&nbsp;<span>You are interested in meeting others in a similar situation and would like to become part of a group whose sole focus is to help 'international women' make more friends :)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Come and join us! We meet once a month in San Francisco (a poll of members showed mid week drinks was the most desired event type) but are always open to have other types of events (lunch, brunch, dinner, picnics, hikes, museums etc). We really encourage members to suggest events.</p>
<p> <br></p>"
Women Gone Wild Adventures,"<p><span>While we love our men and our guy friends, experiencing the outdoors with a group of women is a different game.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to the outdoors, we believe in equity, not necessarily equality. (Don't understand what we mean by that statement? Come check us out and you'll discover the true meaning!)</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in physical strength, but also the inner strength of great women.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in a caring and nurturing community, where all women are free to be themselves - safe to admit their weaknesses, safe to take on new challenges, and safe to explore the boundaries of life without men.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in fostering the independent, strong woman inside of every one of us.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in having a damn good time whether it's ""roughing it"" in a fabulous mountain house and hitting up the spa, or car camping and checking out the local hot springs, or 10-days in the backcountry without a shower.</span></p>
<p><span>Come on, go wild with us!</span></p>
<p><span>(Especially if you are indeed a woman between the ages of 21 and 99.) <br></span></p>
<p>Join our Facebook group: Ecstatic Living By Design&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/groups/ecstaticlife/&nbsp;<br>This group bridges the gap between events and allows us to connect and deepen our relationships even when we are not together.&nbsp; The group also connects individuals from various Meetup groups the organizer runs - a larger community of like-minded individuals in various states and geographical regions!</p>

"I am happy project - Napa, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances. According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego: &ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo; Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity. If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

This is a group for women of African Descent 35 years of age and older who love women. It's for anyone new to the Bay Area or not.&nbsp; If you're looking for a way to meet women close to your age group for friendship and socialization.</span></p>
<p><span>This group was started because many women over the age of 35 have shared their desire to meet other women 35 and over&nbsp;who share similar interest&nbsp;in dining out, dancing, game nights, potlucks, spa days,&nbsp;wine tasting, plays,&nbsp;musicals, concerts,&nbsp;retreats, traveling outside of California and the US, camping, &amp; hiking.

East Bay Ladies 30s/20s Book Club,"<p>Back by popular demand... First, thanks for taking the first step in joining a special group of ladies who love to read, chat, over enjoy a glass of wine. This group was initially started quite a few years ago because our fearless leader is a book junkie who was looking to join a book club in the area and found none. After a year on Facebook, She decided it was time to take the group back where it all started. We read mostly contemporary lit, but do mix it up every so often with a classic. This is the book club for anyone who has read/watched ""The Jane Austin Book Club"" and thought it would be great to connect and share my thoughts with fellow readers. If you want to be more than an attendee and build relationships with other women this is the club for you. We do try and host social events monthly. Believe it or not we love e-mail, so please reach out to us if you have any questions.</p>"

<p>ASAM (pronounced, ""awesome"") is not just your average meetup group. &nbsp;ASAM is intended to be a member-run group, not one of those top-down groups where one organizer decides everything. In other words, the group will have only as many activities as you, the members, collectively suggest and organize. The more you pitch in, the more recreation choices you will have. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We have found that the most amazing people are attracted to the name, ""Awesomely Mediocre."" People who have a sense of humor about themselves are just more fun to be around, plain and simple!&nbsp; If you seek competition, then this Meetup group is not for you. <br></span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Got any Examples of Activities or Sports I Can Attend and/or Organize? &nbsp;Yup!</b></p>

Gals Gone Fun,"<p>'Gals Gone Fun' welcomes women of all ages, whether single or married, regardless of age, ethnicity, or background. The Gals are buddies, pals, friends and chums. Our goal is to socialize, while doing activities we enjoy. 'Gals Gone Fun' will enrich your life with the fun activities we share. We love walking while chatting, then sipping coffee to sounds of laughter and conversation . We love getting out into the East Bay Hills, but we are not serious hikers. Together, we laugh and cry at the movies, and we all agree that the meal afterwards tastes yummier with the 'Gals'. We visit museums, Bay Area attractions, coffee houses, and meals out on the town. We attend concerts and plays, host parties, share cooking creations, knit, sew and bead together, volunteer and participate in fundraising events, plus we talk about books we read and TV series we are watching. Many 'Gals Gone Fun' are devoted to their dogs, so most 'Gal' walks welcome your buddy to our group, 'Dogs Gone Fun'. None of this would be fun without you and your event ideas! So please suggest activities or become a 'Gal' organizer so you can set up and lead some wonderful outings. And if you don't know what to do, just propose your idea and our skilled 'Gals' will gladly help you. We appreciate the friendship of a diversity of women. We know that together we are stronger and happier. Most activities are in central Contra Costa or Alameda County, but we love to explore and stretch our wings, so don't be surprised when we post fun opportunities in SF, Monterey, or anywhere in between.</p>"

<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

Dream Priestess(TM) Circle - Bay Area Women,"<p><span>The Dream Priestess(TM) Circle is a women's gathering where you can explore everyday magic. You will awaken and deepen your spiritual gifts (e.g. intuition), step into your spiritual power as a leader, and play with new ways of accessing spiritual guidance.</span> <br></p>
<p>Whether you're experienced with your spiritual gifts, or just discovering you have them, join us for creative exploration and fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatherings are at my home and there's room for about 10 women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

The GUILD: networking for like-minded professional women,"<p>The GUILD is a networking service for like-minded professional women to help them build stronger connections through 1:1 meetings. In addition, the GUILD plans monthly themed events aimed at a providing our members with the opportunity to gain skills, promote their businesses and organizations, and share best practices. And sometimes we just have fun!</p>"
"Women Who Dine, Drink, and Curse","<p>If you're a woman who is interested in making new friends and you have a relaxed attitude, join us! The plan is to have frequent and varied events so there is always something on the agenda. Dinners, brunch, scenic walks, festivals, happy hour--we'll try to find interesting and fun things to do.</p>
<p>I hate to start out with a rules list but in attending other meet-ups, I think it's important to set expectations. The best Meet Up group I was involved in only allowed 100 members and kept a waitlist of prospects. The administrator set up basic rules at the very beginning. Long lasting friendships resulted from that group and I'd love to see the same thing here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So, these are the ""rules""</b></p>
<p>1. If you sign up and are inactive for 2 months, you're automatically removed. If you're going out of town or will be inactive but want to remain involved, just shoot us an email and we'll keep you active.</p>
<p>2. If you RSVP and then are a no show twice, you're removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We'll cap the group at 100. Please, if you join, look around and decide this isn't for you, leave the group so there's room for someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The yearly fee for membership is $5.00. It costs $15 per month to keep the group active. Once that is paid for, the remaining fees will be used however the group sees fit--a party or perhaps a holiday donation to a charity. Meet Up no longer allows us to accept fees through the group so we request that you either pay $5 at your first meet up or use PayPal.</p>
<p>5. You are welcome to attend the first event on us, if you want to continue, please pay the fee. If you attend an event and then we don't hear from you, we'll remove you so someone else can join.</p>
<p>6. We won't accept members who don't have a photo of themselves in their bio. We want to be able to recognize you at meet ups. It also cuts down on people who spam huge numbers of groups.</p>
<p>7. We won't accept members who do not live in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. We won't accept members who don't have a personal profile picture. We want to be able to recognize you at events and to know you are a real person.</p>
<p><b>Finally, if you are interested in organizing events and setting up meet-ups, please let us know. It is really helpful to have several active organizers putting in events. It's also a great opportunity to find people who like to do the things you like to do!&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Input is appreciated. If you have suggestions for the group, we want to hear them so don't be shy.</b></p>
<p><b>Thank you.</b></p>"

Conscious Uncoupling Group Support for Divorce and Breakups,"<p><span>Are you feeling hurt, sad and alone - perhaps even emotionally distraught - over a divorce or breakup? Dealing with an ex who refuses to acknowledge their actions, or to step up and handle your separation with kindness and consciousness? Are you doing your best to surf waves of grief and sadness? Or perhaps even like you were hit by a truck and confused about what happened?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you feeling a lack of resolution or clarity? Wondering how you can avoid going through something like this again? Or perhaps even hopeless about having another relationship?</span> <br></p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, there is hope. It doesn't matter if your divorce or breakup was a few weeks ago or a few years ago; getting the right kind of support and doing some self-reflection is not just critical to your own healing, but also the doorway to even better relationships with a future partner, your friends and family and - perhaps most of all - yourself.</p>
<p>I became a Conscious Uncoupling coach after I went through my own devastating break up. I felt all of these things.... hit by a truck!&nbsp; Devastated!! Confused!&nbsp; And my ex refused to even explain to me what was happening or why. It has taken time and work - showing up - but I know I am a better person / friend / family member for it, and I will make a much better partner in the future. I feel empowered and hopeful, and you will, too.</p>
<p>This group will offer:</p>
<p>1. informational sessions about Conscious Uncoupling: what it is, how to do it, and how to decide whether to do it on your own or with a coach.</p>
<p>2. Group coaching in a confidential and deeply loving and supportive group.</p>
<p>3. One-day workshops that will be nurturing, informative, eye-opening and healing.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you at an event. Events will be held in both Folsom and Placerville.</p>

Bay Area Indian Divorce Support & Recovery Group (IDSRG),"<p>Few years ago, I had started Bay Area Indian Single Parents &amp; Divorcees group, the group was community partners with India Community Center (ICC).

Plus unfortunate it is, that I find myself in family court, seeking Nullity and looking for support again. Not finding any, starting this new group for divorce support and recovery.</p>
<p>You can join this group if you are of Indian origin, living in bay area and going through divorce or divorced looking for support. I'll allow middle-aged never married singles in the group, it there intent is to find life partner and settle down. If you are trying to save your marriage, please try hard, especially if you have kids. The grass always looks green on other side, but it never is!</p>
<p>Note, this group is not a party group or a pickup joint. Dating is not the goal, but if long term relationships and remarriages happen between group members, we all will be happy and wish them well.</p>
<p>This a community effort and I would like all members to participate. We can be friends, provide support 1-1 or have discussions in group setting. We could have attorneys, educators, mediators, counselors, therapists and parenting experts come give talks to group members. Is there is enough interest, I will look to partner with ICC again. I'm a First Year Law School student myself and would be willing to help (pro-bono) anyone who reaches out to me, limited by my knowledge and experience. Please do note that I am not an attorney as yet, so anything I say or do is friendly help and any action you take based on discussions in this group is at your own risk. You should always get your legal advice from your attorney.</p>
<p>All members are recommended to maintain clear photo on their profile, use complete/real name and answer all profile question honestly. I understand its not always feasible to have profile photo and real name while going through divorce, in that case, please you must send me a private message with real identity.</p>
<p>Everything discussed in the group will be confidential and all members will treat fellow members with respect, be sensitive to their issues.</p>
<p>This is a group for good people who find themselves in an unfortunate situation, need support and want to live though difficult times.</p>"

I would like to see a Bisexual Meetup Group for women take off so I decided to start one myself (: It didn't seem like we were represented at all in the SAC area so would love to change that! If anyone is interested in co-chairing this group with me I would invite that, as work can always get overwhelming- right? If you're a woman who is interested in drinks/dinner after work, hiking, festivals, music jams, &nbsp;pool parties, shopping haunts, day trips, camping, BBQ, wineries, game nights, art galleries, movie and popcorn night ------then these are a few of the fun simple things we can do together as a general brainstorm. Couples and singles, anyone looking to spice up their social life. I would like to facilitate new friendships and support women who might be new to the area, or finding out who they are, want to mix with like-minded gals, or just flat out want someone fun to hang out with on Friday night! </p>"
Auburn Empty Nest Book Club,"<p>This is intended to be a fun, easy-going, book club/social club; with the expectation that socializing is equally as important as the literary aspect of the group:) If you are a woman 50 through 60's interested in attending we would love to have you join! We will meet 1:30 p.m. one weekday a month. The Organizer has ultimate membership approval.</p>"

<p><b>Are you ready to become a public speaker?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Do you know that speaking is the #1 way you can get clients when you have your own business?</b></p>
<p><b>Speaking is something that every entrepreneur should be focusing more on:&nbsp;</b><br></p>
<p>- how to do it</p>
<p>- what to speak about</p>
<p>- how to incorporate it into your business</p>
<p>- how to get leads from speaking</p>
<p>- how to sell from stage or how to sell from a webinar</p>
<p>But the problem is that very few entrepreneurs actually do this. OR they do it but don't really understand how it can correlate to sales in their business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Speaking is something that you want to get some training with on:</b><br></p>
<p>- how to create your talks and presentations</p>
<p>- how to own the stage</p>
<p>- how to create a speaker sheet</p>
<p>- how to get speaking gigs and opportunities</p>
<p>- how to present yourself during the speaking gig</p>
<p>- how to gather leads during speaking gigs&nbsp;</p>
<p>- in person or virtually</p>
<p>- how to sell from stage&nbsp;</p>
<p>- how to follow up effectively (most of your sales will come in the follow up!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- how to present yourself as a speaker on your website and online social profiles</p>
<p>- and soooo much more!</p>
<p>The webinar here is a snippet of what we do at the Sacramento Speaker &amp; Entrepreneur Network meetings and online webinars. We have a community on Meetup and Facebook that anyone can join to learn more about speaking to grow your business, entrepreneurship, business and marketing.&nbsp;</p>

Many of our faculty are themselves investors and entrepreneurs, and bring a wealth of experience to the mix.</p>
<p>This group is yet another step in our commitment to providing resources to the broader Bay Area business world. We hope to provide a platform for dialog between entrepreneurs, investors, students, Civic leaders and educators through hosting networking events and helping others do the same.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>"

San Mateo Business Masters,"<p>The San Mateo Business Masters group is first and foremost a free entrepreneur networking group for solo-preneurs and owner-operated businesses of all sizes. Whether you are a business veteran or a new entrepreneur, our networking events provide for a safe and secure environment to all. In fact, the diversity in members brings added benefits to us all.</p>
<p>We meet once a week for a breakfast mixer and to discuss and learn about local business and entrepreneurship issues. The meetings start promptly with the mixer portion (networking) of the event. Then, while we eat breakfast we invite the speaker of the week to enlighten us about different aspect of business management. Each week the topics and the speakers are different. Then after the meeting, members who desire can stick around or set appointments to get to know each other better.Members of the group with relevant topics will be invited to speak in front of the group and share their expertise if they desire to.</p>
<p>In this challenging economy it is important to have a group of peers and business associates to count on. Yet, most networking groups, like BNI's and BRN's are nothing more than a place to pass business cards around.</p>
<p>Business Masters is different. We understand that solid and long term business relationships are not forged by handing business cards to strangers, but rather by connecting with people and making friends. Like a member previously stated: ""Nobody cares to do business with business cards, but we all care about people!""</p>
<p>Unlike many other networking groups that charge you hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year, Business Masters is 100% no charge. Obviously you have to buy your own food, but that's it. We know that by not charging a membership fee more people are inclined to attend. The more people who attend the more relationship bonds are created. That's how economies are created!</p>
<p>We are all looking forward to meeting you at next week's event.</p>"

<p>I love doing random fun stuff throughout the week, hiking, exploring anything anywhere, trying new things (because that new thing could turn into something awesome or a new hobby), sports (going to a game, watching sports on TV, and playing sports!), doing random weekend trips, and going to awesome events! I'm always down to do anything!</p>
<p>So I want to meet people that are compassionate, fun, caring, honest, and all other types of awesomeness that also like to do random fun stuff with other fun people. And it would also be really great for all of us to expand our networks. I would love to meet people that are involved in local non-profit organization and in international non-profit organizations, but of course EVERYONE (no matter what you do) is welcomed!</p>

Girl Develop It San Jose,"<p>Women Developers and Programmers!<br>

 Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.</p>
<p><br>

 It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask ""stupid questions.""</p>
<p><br>

 We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>

The group organizer, Karen Miller, is available by appointment for individual or group instruction. <br></p>

Our meetings will include motivational movies or CD excerpts from various progressive thinkers and teachers, insightful experiential exercises, enlightening group processes and opportunities to share, connect with and support each other.

Challenging times call us to sharpen our focus, clarify our intention, take action consistent with our deepest desires and to surrender to trusting Spirit and Law of attraction like never before. They also call us to leave our houses and entrenched fearful minds, to reach out and empower each other in the deepest, most meaningful and impactful ways. Believe me, there are people making lots of money right now, experiencing profound health, joyous relationships and wondrous living, and you can too!

Oakland LifeFire Laughter Yoga,"<p>Want to jumpstart your joy? Join us and get happified!</p>
<p>The global Laughter Yoga movement was started by Dr. Madan Kataria, an MD from India, in 1995. There are now over 6000 ""Laughter Clubs"" in over 70 countries around the world spreading peace and joy through laughter! <br> <br>Laughter Yoga does not use the familiar ""Hatha Yoga"" poses or asanas. It is not based on humor or jokes, which are very subjective. Rather it combines playful, easy laughter exercises with yogic breathing and a final relaxation. And like yoga it IS a ""practice"", also called ""intentional laughter"", that taps into the mind-body connection to lift your mood, reduce stress, lower blood pressure and boost your immune system while you have fun. After laughing and playing with this fabulous group, you will leave energized and relaxed. How cool is that!</p>
<p>Oakland LIfefire Laughter Yoga was started in 2007&nbsp;by Annie Goglia, a certified Laughter Yoga Teacher and Life Coach.&nbsp;Annie loves&nbsp;to share&nbsp;her laughter with others with an open heart. She&nbsp;was trained by the founder of Laughter Yoga, Dr. Kataria. In 2013, Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Liz Nichols joined her as co-leader. <br></p>
<p>We are usually a mix of ""regulars"" and newcomers. Drop-ins are super-welcome. No mats needed. Adults and older teens of all levels of physically fitness are welcome. Wear comfortable clothing for easier laughing.</p>
<p><strong>Laughing with others is priceless. Oakland LifeFire Laughter Meetups are free! We welcome donations to help with our costs. You can click on the ""chip in"" button on the left, or bring your donation when you come to a Meetup.</strong></p>

Milpitas Yoga Meditation Mind-Body Wellness Group,"<p><span style=""font-size : medium""><strong>-- No Breath No Life, Know Breath Know Life --</strong></span></p>
<p>Welcome! We are a group of people who learn and practice the Yoga of Breath as a means to total wellness of a healthy body and a stress-free mind. Beginners, intermediate practitioners, seasoned yogis ... all are part of this group.</p>
<p>The first act we do in our life is to breathe in. And the last act of our life is to breathe out. Between this first breath in and the last breath out are all the breaths that we call life. The breath is our best friend -- it's always with us. And yet, we hardly know much about it. What's more ... it holds some timeless secrets to our health, peace of mind, and well-being.</p>
<p>""There is a great secret in the breath. You have an in-built ability to calm the mind, heal the body, and energize the whole system in minutes. The secret is in the breath.""</p>
<p>With just a little practice it's easy to use your breath to instantly</p>
<ul>
<li>infuse your body with energy</li>
<li>detoxify through the breath</li>
<li>make your mind calm</li>
<li>control negative emotions</li>
<li>increase focus and concentration</li>
<li>create a sense of well-being</li>
</ul>

Successful relationships also take skill. Skills like setting and enforcing boundaries, actively respecting yourself and others, knowing when and how to take care of yourself, being assertive--all play a part. I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist, and I realized I was teaching the same skills to all my clients. I created this class for my clients, their spouses, and others to accelerate their learning of crucial relationship skills at a low cost. Learn winning strategies and un-learn losing strategies in this eye-opening, interactive group. And if you're in therapy or working a 12-step program, this will definitely give your process a boost!

San Jose - Manjushri Lineage Buddhist Group,"<p>Hello<br> <br> LEARN, CONTEMPLATE, CULTIVATE and TRANSFORM.<br> <br> Welcome to the <span>meetup group</span> ""Inner Peace &amp; Happiness Buddhist Study and Meditation&nbsp;Group"". This is a wonderful opportunity, whether you are just beginning or have been studying for awhile, to join other warm-heart, sincere Buddhist Practitioners as we explore Mahayana &amp; Vajrayana Buddhism.<br> <br> Buddhism is about transforming the mind and discovering the path to true happiness. To achieve this, first we need to take focused action to uproot the negative emotions, destructive mental constructs, and negative habits that continually cause suffering for ourselves. We also need to cultivate virtues in our mind such as compassion, loving-kindness, and wisdom. This way we can transform ourselves to a point where we experience stability, peace of mind, and lightness within our own mind. This results in happiness for ourselves and others.<br> <br> Our group is under the guidance of our precious Lama Namnang Mingjo Dorje Rinpoche, a very humble yet immensely accomplished yogi, whose sincerity, dedication &amp; guidance is very inspiring &amp; brings the <span>Buddhist teachings</span> alive in our daily lives.<br> <br> The aim of our group is to provide our members with both an in-person as well as online learning environment to explore the incredible wisdom and application of Buddhism. We have on-going weekly teachings &amp; study groups that provide practitioners with an opportunity to not only learn <span>Buddhist philosophy</span>, helping us to better understand the interplay of cause and effect (the law of karma) and help us to contemplate and look at ways to change ourselves. As well as learn <span>Buddhist meditation practices</span> that help us to increase &amp; stabilize key virtues (charity, ethical discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom) within us, and give us a first-hand personal experience of what it is like to experience a mind that is stable, quiet, calm, peaceful, joyful and light.<br> <br> This is a very rare opportunity to study Buddhism in a beautiful blessed environment together with a group of sincere seekers. All of us are also searching and wishing to discover and nurture the essence of our Buddha potential. Come and join us.

"Reiki Tummo Healing, Heart Meditation & Natural Walking","<p>""All truth is in your heart, not in the physical heart, but in the core within yourself where your true self resides. To access that truth you must open your heart and Reiki TUMMO can help you do just that. When you learn Reiki TUMMO you are introduced to energy channeling for healing, but also as a tool to lead you into your heart so you can learn directly from your heart, rather than from others.""&nbsp; Irmansyah Effendi M.Sc (founder)</p>

SpreadKindness.org,"<p>This group is for people who believe in practicing acts of kindness in everyday life. If we can get more people doing this then the world will become a happier place where peace and joy happen.</p>
<p>Join us as we inspire, enlighten, and make someone's day happy through sincere kindness of our hearts. Together we can make a world of difference- one person at a time. If you do one random act of kindness everyday it will put a smile on both your face and also on the face of the other person.</p>
<p>Location: This group will travel around the Bay Area to do&nbsp;acts of kindness&nbsp;for people, organizations, and individuals.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: You're likely to feel good and become addicted to practice acts of kindness everyday!</p>
<p>Visit our website: <a href=""http://www.SpreadKindness.org"" /><a href=""http://www.SpreadKindness.org""><a href=""http://www.SpreadKindness.org"" title=""http://www.SpreadKindness.org"" target=""_blank"">http://www.SpreadKindness.org</a></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves. &rdquo;</p>

The East Bay NLP Meetup Group,"<p>This is a Meet Up for people interested in Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).</p>
<p>NLP is called ""The Study of the Structure of Human Experience."" It is also a self development practice: Once we know something about how we structure our experience, we can find ways to re-structure it in ways that provide us with the experience of life we would prefer.</p>
<p>NLP is a remarkably elegant and deeply respectful set of tools to uncover unconscious beliefs and structures that determine our experience, and--again, at the unconcious level--introduce new beliefs and structures to our hidden selves.</p>
<p>At these meetups, we learn and practice NLP techniques, and learn about and discuss NLP principles and frameworks. We have had a number of meetups so far and they have let people practice NLP skills in a relaxed, fun environment. We've had everyone from experienced practitioners to those just starting out.</p>
<p>For those of you who know something about NLP, we've worked on anchoring, rapport, language patterns, parts work, and much more. So come and explore!</p>"
The Magic of Living,"<p>Welcome to <b>The Magic of Living</b> meetup, formerly the <b>Bay Area Law of Attraction Boosters</b>.</p>

<p>We provide workshops and events to explore how mindfulness, surrender and the law of attraction can remove chaos, simplify and bring you the life you truly want.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more or in meeting like-minded individuals, interested in a conscious (and fun!) path of living, please join!</p>

The Shadow Effect Meet Up,"<p>
  <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
  <strong>What is the Shadow?</strong>
</p>
<p>The shadow contains all the parts of ourselves that we try to hide, deny or suppress. It is the keeper of all the aspects of ourselves that we dislike and the qualities that we judge as unacceptable. The shadow wears many faces: angry, critical, fearful, lazy, controlling, selfish, weak, pathetic&hellip; These are the faces we don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t want to show the world and the faces we don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t want to show ourselves. Most of us expend huge amounts of energy trying to get rid of or control these unwanted aspects of ourselves. We hope that by hiding or fixing our 
<span>""</span>bad qualities
<span>""</span> we will have the peace, success and happiness we desire. Most of us are convinced that we are flawed and inadequate so we become masters of disguise, and go to great lengths to hide our bad qualities from those around us &ndash; even from ourselves.</p>
<p>The result of turning our backs on our dark side? A life that slips by only half lived. Dreams that are never realized, or worse, that lay buried under years of resignation and shame. Until we make peace with our shadow we will continue to be at war with ourselves. And our outer world will mirror our inner struggle. What we resist persists &ndash; and we will create and attract from others that which we most dislike in ourselves. Until we feel authentic compassion for each and every aspect of ourselves, we will continue to draw forth people and events that will mirror the negative feelings we have about ourselves. Until we take back our power and forgive ourselves for being human we will attract people who push our buttons and reactivate our emotional wounds. And until we find the courage to love ourselves completely, we will never truly be able to experience the love from those around us. We don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t need to guess how we really feel about ourselves at the deepest level. All we have to do is look at how the outer world treats us. If we
<span>&rsquo;</span>re not getting the respect, love and appreciation we desire from the outer world, it
<span>&rsquo;</span>s more than likely we aren
<span>&rsquo;</span>t giving these things to ourselves. This is the benevolence of the Universe in action. The whole world is a mirror of our own consciousness, and when we make peace with the disowned aspects of ourselves, we make peace with the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <strong>The Shadow Effect Movie</strong>
</p>
<p>The Shadow Effect, a visually stunning and cutting-edge documentary, will inspire you to step out of the self that you&rsquo;ve known and break free from the bonds of the past. Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Dr. David Simon, and other world-renowned thinkers join Debbie Ford to reveal the transformative power of your shadow&mdash;the parts of yourself that you dislike and disown, the past that you regret and repress, and the future that is waiting to be birthed. The Shadow Effect will leave you breathing deeper as you take back your power and step into the possibility of the next greatest evolution of yourself.

"Love, Intuition and Spirituality","<p>The purpose of this group is to learn how to live from love, and connect to your intuition and spirituality. There are only 2 basic emotions, fear and love. If you choose to live from love and inner wisdom, this meetup is for you.</p>
<p>Your intuition is how your higher self, your spirit, communicates with you. It is all wise, all knowing and all loving. It knows the past, present and future and is not programmed like the mind is. Everyone is intuitive. It comes with the human package. Only fears block it. Remove your fears and you can live as the master of your life!</p>
<p>Spirituality is living from love rather than fear. It is choosing to be the loving person you really are. Awaken to your true essence of love and your life can be amazing! It has helped me be healthier, happier, more successful, and fulfilled in every area of my life! And you can, too! Go for it!<br></p>
<p>The fun and profound events are healing and transformational, because the goal is to to help you to enjoy a peaceful, loving and joyful life. <br></p>

Connecting With Nature,"<p>Nature Connection Events - We evolved in communication with the natural world, our nervous systems need nature. In our modern world we often become separated from our connection to nature. Reconnecting with nature is reconnecting with our essence, regrounding us and rebalancing our nervous system. In this group we'll seek out unique ways of connecting with the natural world.</p>"

Santa Cruz Meditation Group,"<p>Healthy minds dance for joy! Come celebrate and explore the experiences of a lifetime! Meditate, dance, shake, visualize , draw, and talk to keep your mind and body in good health. Find the skills that work for you! <br> <br>This is the place where you get to try out different experiences from the field of Mind-Body Medicine. Mind-Body Medicine is an up and coming integrative health perspective. It links our overall health to the connection between our mind and body. Most people talk about the benefits of Mind-Body Medicine as learning skills for good health. Its true benefit to you is having <span><strong>experiences</strong></span> which positively affect you. The experience of participating with this group will positively change your understanding. You won't know what you've been missing until you try it. Similar experiences improved my outlook on life a thousand fold! I am healthier than I've ever been, where it really counts! in my head! The impact of this positive change in my life and everyone around me has been astonishing. Care to be astonished? <br> <br>I wish I could say that meditation is the best way to start. Its how I started, its what I'm best at, and its how I got to be here. After seeing the experiences others have had by participating in Mind-Body exercises I have to say its not! Mind-Body exercises work faster and are more fun! Meditation is the purest mental exercise though and can become a wonderful part of your life as well. This group will engage you on many levels from dancing for joy to the deepest meditative experience. <br> <br>Yeh! <br> <br>Outside of being a genius with a passion for this stuff, who am I? Professionally I am a civil engineer with 19 years of experience. I've loved playing sports my whole life. I am very competitive and fair! I am not affiliated with any religion. Malyn, co-organizer, is my girlfriend, she works professionally as a pediatrician. In addition to our personal experience we have both received training through the Center of Mind Body Medicine in Washington DC. As I mentioned earlier, this training provides alternatives to meditation that can achieve similar results, sometimes even faster than meditation! <br> <br>Background <br> <br>Meditation is a label for many activities which are universal to humanity. Even the simple act of conversing with another person can be a meditative experience. Physical relaxation can also coincide with a meditative experience. When I talk about meditation it includes these types of introductory experiences and more advanced skills. I started this group because I've benefited enormously from meditating, and it all began unknowingly; I didn't know I was meditating! To be honest, I just wanted to be happy. I've discovered how to be happier, how to allow myself to be at my best without thinking about it. Everyone wants to know the answer, How? The secret is...this gritty stuff called emotions. Emotions are there to help us, not just some emotions, all of them. The more this is understood, the more beautiful life becomes. For many people, there are times emotions do not help, its these that can be transformed. Emotions are difficult to work with by their very nature. The group is intended to provide an environment to help you with these in the best possible way, have some fun, share some stories, relax, and also work through some of those emotions. Not me you might say? How can you afford the time? How can you not? What would you give to be happier every day for the rest of your life? I just wish I had figured this stuff out sooner! The goal is to create habitual positive experiences, as natural as brushing your teeth before you go to bed. The result? Living more beautifully with each passing day. <br> <br>Although I love to use positive words like happiness and beauty when thinking about this stuff, understand this isn't about focusing on being happy, to the detriment of your emotional range, sadness, anger, grief. Its about changing your perspective and experience of living, so that you experience the best possible emotion for the moment you are in. Its not about ignoring the past or the future but finding a way to understand them in new ways. Its by experiencing transformations of perspective personally that change happens. Again, the secret is not to study, but to experience. In this group, the goal is to have a range of transformational experiences, some will incrementally affect you almost without notice, others will be immediately life altering. There are mind-body exercises which can lead to instantaneous transformational experiences and these will be used to augment the core mediation. The point is to set time aside to develop skills for making life easier, fuller, with more happiness, calm, and resilience. <br> <br>Yeh! Again!</p>"
"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>"

A Confidential Therapy Group for Women!,"<p>Welcome! This wonderful, confidential therapy group is facilitated by local clinical psychologist Carla Marie Manly, Ph.D. The group focuses on a variety of important issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and isolation. The group provides support and encouragement during life transitions such as divorce, relationship changes, and career changes. We work on setting and achieving personal goals within a positive, meaningful framework. The group provides a safe place for women of all ages to build their confidence, receive feedback, and find inner strength by sharing with other women in a safe and peaceful environment. This group also offers skill-building and strategies to help women cope with life stresses and challenges. This group is limited to 7 members and is ongoing on a weekly basis. The fee is $25.00 per session.</p>
<p>At the start of each group, each member has an opportunity to check in and discuss current challenges and concerns in a supportive and encouraging environment. We address a wide variety of important topics such as anxiety, depression, isolation, relationship concerns, and low self-esteem. Compassionate, therapeutic insights are offered to promote healing, self-awareness, and positive changes. We focus on understanding and utilizing practical strategies to improve self-confidence, coping skills, and interpersonal relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>As we move through various topics, you'll find that your inner awareness and strength grows. You will come away from each session with a better understanding of yourself and how you interact with others. You'll find encouragement in meeting with other women whose life experiences illuminate your own struggles. A sense of vital interconnection develops as you realize that your own insights and experiences also benefit others! The group discussions change as we move forward, and the themes will evolve naturally as life circumstances change.<em><strong>The ultimate goal is to help each woman create the joy-filled, passionate life of her dreams!</strong></em></p>

Auburn Reiki Center Meetup Group,"<p><b><i>""Come, come, whoever you are. Wanderer, worshiper, lover of leaving. It doesn't matter. Ours is not a caravan of despair. Come, even if you have broken your vow a thousand times. Come, yet again, come, come."" </i></b><i>~Inscribed on Rumi's Shrine in Konya, Turkey~</i></p>

SF Women with ADHD,"<p>Welcome to the largest ADHD tribe in the SF Bay Area! We are the SF Women with ADHD. We are dedicated to bonding with like-minded and awesome women!!!!! &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>"
Bay Area Sound Healing Group,"<p>Resonant Harmony Attunements</p>
<p>The Resonant Harmony Attunements are designed for two purposes:</p>
<p>1. To Create Community Where We are All Connected &ndash; When you share sound together, everyone's whole system shares the same vibration or frequency -- brainwaves, heart rates, and electromagnetic fields align, and we all become like family. In fact, sharing sound together is a portal to remembering the ultimate state of where we are all One -- particularly when the sound ends and we enter that divine place of peace where we disappear. We believe this is the ultimate goal, Oneness -- for when we exist in a world where we are all one there is no more conflict, no more war -- and only love and light permeate all of our relationships. Coming together in sound creates this Community, where we are all connected, one with all humanity and life --including everything on the planet.</p>
<p>2. To Bring Us into Higher States of Consciousness &ndash; A Higher Frequency - There are two general types of states: <br />a. A State of Bliss &ndash; Defining &ldquo;Bliss&rdquo; as any high state of consciousness &ndash; including that of Gratitude, Compassion, Joy, and Love (personal and Universal). This state could be simply Perfect Presence or simply just a sweet state of Well Being. Of course, music often takes us to such a place. It is even more powerful when the underlying sounds are also working towards inducing the same state, and when you include a powerful Intention. <br />b. A State of Deep Peace &ndash; Not just silence (because silence can be uncomfortable), but a place of peace like no other. It happens when the sound ends on the root, home note of the song and fades ever so slowly -- seamlessly melding into the silence. When this happens the last frequency heard remains in the room &ndash; humming ever so still. The slower the fade, the better.</p>
<p><br />The Events include many different Experiences. Sometimes a night might be devoted to one particular type of experience; Often we will have multiple experiences in one night:</p>
<p>1. Sound Healing Concerts &ndash; Wide variety of groups based around Sound Healing and Raising Consciousnes.</p>
<p>2. Sound Journeys &ndash; Experience the healing and consciousness raising aspects of sound as you lay on the floor with your eyes closed. We play a wide range of natural sounds all around you, including using the voice to induce higher states of consciousness. The journeys often include Crystal Bowls and Tibetan Bowls.</p>
<p>3. Toning with Intention &ndash; Most of our meditations are done with a conscious stated Intention. It is well-known and has been proven through research that Intention really does work.</p>
<p>4. Chanting &ndash; Chanting songs from around the world. No singing experience required. We often do Kirtan (Call and response).</p>
<p>5. Sound Healing Music &ndash; Wide range of live and recorded Sounds and Music to bring you into a state of bliss and deep peace.</p>
<p>6. Sound and Movement &ndash; Taking sound into form in the body and throughout the chakras.</p>
<p>7. Guided Meditations with Sound &ndash; From releasing stuck emotions and energy to resonating higher forms of sound and light consciousness.</p>"

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Earth Wisdom and The Michael Teachings Channeling Group,"<p><img src=""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/7/event_16852119.jpeg""></p>
<p><strong>WELCOME to EARTH WISDOM and THE MICHAEL TEACHINGS CHANNELING GROUP!</strong> <br> <br>Earth Wisdom and the Michael Teachings Open Channeling Group meets every other Wednesday in Santa Rosa for an alternating <strong>OPEN TOPIC</strong> format channeled meetup group, where any and all questions are welcome, and a <strong>TOPIC BASED</strong> format, which is chosen by the group members each month at the <strong>1st</strong> <strong>OPEN TOPIC</strong> meetup of the month. <br> <br>Both newbies to <b>The Michael Teachings</b> and seasoned Michael students are equally welcome and respected in this meetup group. </p>
<p><span>Please feel free to invite your friends to this group as well, if you wish. <em><strong>RSVP responses to the meetups are encouraged and are greatly appreciated</strong></em> so we will have a better idea of how people many to expect at each of our meetup groups. Thanks! :-) <br></span></p>
<p><span>Be sure to visit our <strong><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Earth-Wisdom-and-The-Michael-Teachings/messages/boards/"">DISCUSSION FORUM</a> </strong>between meetup groups for more information on The Michael Teachings, an excellent article on ""The History of Channeling"",&nbsp; inspirational quotes and messages, astrological forecasts, monthly trends and more.&nbsp; And, last but not least, please check out our <strong><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Earth-Wisdom-and-The-Michael-Teachings/calendar/"">CALENDAR</a></strong> for future meetup dates, times and locations, and for upcoming <strong>SPECIAL EVENTS</strong> that may be scheduled for this meetup group in the near future as well. <br> <br><strong><span>What Is This Meetup Group All About Anyway?</span></strong> <br> <br>This meetup group is based primarily upon the teachings of the ancient mid-causal plane entity teacher known simply as Michael, who was first popularized in the best-selling book, ""Messages from Michael"" by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro in the late 1970's. Many excellent books have since been published through numerous other Michael channels, adding depth, breadth and an ongoing evolution to the original channeled works. <br> <br>The Michael Teachings are a profoundly practical and directly applicable philosophy of life that sheds light upon the the nature of the self, one's relationships with others and on the workings underlying all life and the cosmos in general. It is a teaching designed for use and application on the physical plane, and is very grounded and geared to give each student a kind of map of the world from and through which they may more fully examine, evaluate and evolve their understanding of their own personal life experiences. <br> <br>A major part of Michael's teaching is concerned with reincarnation, its implications and ramifications. Part of this teaching is based upon a system of personality traits called ""overleaves"". Michael gave the information to increase our understanding of self and others, thereby improving the quality of life and relationships. Michael also intended the material be used to accelerate spiritual growth. <br> <br>This group is also based upon indigenous shamanic perspectives and practices from around the world, utilized in conjunction with the Michael Teachings perspective for an even deeper dive into the nature of your own personal reality and what makes YOU tick, from the inside, out. Working with our animal totems and learning about the traditional 9 Directions and the Michael Teachings 12 Support Circle functions are all included in the work I do with others both online and locally. <br> <br><strong>Who Is Michael?</strong> <br> <br>Michael is a collective consiousness comprised of approximately 1050 individual souls who have all completed their lifetimes on earth and have cycled off of the physical plane all together.&nbsp; They now teach as a recombined entity group from the causal plane perspective through various channels, bringing forth information to assist humanity along its spiritual path of life on the physical plane. <br> <br>Michael teaches that all is choice, that belief is not required, to test out and to question these teachings for yourself, and that personal validation of of one's own essence is the means by which humans progress themselves along the path of return to the Tao. Invalidation of essence serves only to retard and to inhibit such progress, according to Michael. The goal of these teachings is to develop an ever greater capacity for agage` and for unconditional love in our lives. They also offer their causal plane insights without expectation and with unconditional love and carry no expectations of their students, period. They simply offer insight as they see it and each person is free to use what they will and to discard the rest if it doesn't resonate or ring true for them personally.<em>&nbsp; (*Note: This entity group is NOT the Archangel Michael.)</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Who Would Enjoy Being Part of This Group? </strong> <br> <br>This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn more about themselves, their relationships with others, the underlying structure of life, the world in which we live and the universe in general.&nbsp; Bring yourself, your friends and your questions to an upcoming meetup and experience for yourself what this ancient, humorous and insightful causal plane teacher has to offer you along your own personal path of return to the Tao. <br> <br>I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you better through our regularly scheduled channeled meetup groups each month. Thank you for your interest in this group and I hope you will enjoy both the information and the comaraderie that you will find in our growing community. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about this group or any of the upcoming scheduled events. <br> <br>Best Blessings to you each and all, <br> <br>Warmly, Terri&nbsp; (aka: LadyHawk and EquuSpirit online)</span></p>"

Adapt Foundation,"<p>The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.</p>
<p>We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.</p>
<p>There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.</p>
<p>The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you. You are certainly welcome to join us!</p>"

Family Constellations-East Bay Meet-Up,"This group is dedicated to the healing of the mind, body and spirit. Through constellation work participants can connect to their own ancestors. Participants can find resolution to the places in life that are stuck, whether this is with success, romantic relationships, family, career or finances. When the family system is a good order, love flows to us and success comes to us. When the family system is stuck, life can be a struggle. The family system can be tangled from any unresolved trauma from past generations, known or unknown to members of the family. Unresolved trauma could be a sibling that died in childhood, a parent that lost their parent at an early age, a grandfather surviving WWII. The unresolved trauma lives on in the family soul. This can block us from success, health, romantic relationships, career and finances we desire in life. If you are experiencing blocks that you can't associate to anything specific, Or if you are experiencing blocks that stems from an undefined sadness, this group may be for you. Find the deep peace and relief from family constellations."

Santa Cruz Evening Toastmasters - Est. 1991,"<p><b>Toastmasters</b> is the world's leading public speaking and leadership development program. Our <b>Evening Toastmasters Live Oak, Santa Cruz, California</b> meets every <b>Monday EVENING at 6:30PM</b>. <br></p>
<p>Our members DO NOT have to wake up at the crack of dawn to enjoy all that Toastmasters offers. <br></p>
<p>Most people associate the name Toastmasters with public speaking improvement training, but did you know that public speaking is only HALF of what we offer? <br></p>
<p><b>The Evening Toastmasters offers two parallel self improvement programs: </b> <br></p>
<p><b>Competent Communicator</b> - 10 standard projects which will incrementally improve and fine tune your presentation skills. You may move through your projects at your own comfortable pace. <br></p>
<p><b>Competent Leadership</b> - Ten Leadership projects which will improve and fine tune your listening and management skills. You can become a polished and more effective manager, business leader or entrepreneur at your own pace. <br></p>
<p><b>Evening Toastmasters</b> is a well established club having its beginnings in 1991. Founded by <b>Dan Robin</b>, <b>Steve Hardy</b> (still an active member) and a few others, including <b>Jim Griffin</b> from the <b>SCO Club</b> in Santa Cruz. Our club started at a little library room in Santa Cruz, and has now grown to occupy a very comfortable space in the <b>Live Oak Senior's Center at 1777 Capitola Road, Santa Cruz, CA 95062. </b> <br></p>
<p><b>Plenty of free parking and only a short walk from your car to our front door. <br></b></p>

Then, when you are ready, you may become a Mentor and help one or more of the next group on their way to reaching their personal goals. <br></p>
<p>Now here's something we have not mentioned... <b>do you like to LAUGH and have FUN?</b></p>

Corporate Leadership Development Meetup,"<p>Hello potential leaders,</p> 
<p>This is a group for you if you would like to develop your leadership skills. Transitioning from senior management of a company to leadership is not an easy transition. What I found is that to make the transition successfully, executives must navigate a tricky set of changes in their leadership focus and skills. They must learn to move from specialist to generalist, analyst to integrator, tactician to strategist, problem solver to agenda setter, warrior to diplomat.</p> 
<p>The agenda for this group would be to help each other through this transition. We would do that by sharing our experiences and learnings in the organizations we work for. This group is idea for those who are in management roles and would like to pursue leadership opportunities (VP, SVP, EVP, C-suite). This group is also for those who are in leadership roles and would like to grow further into those roles. Although age is no bar, it would be best if we target folks in 30s and early 40s age group. We would meet regularly and exchange ideas, information. I would like to get suggestions from group members as to what the agenda/activity for meetups should be. At my end, I transitioned into a leadership role recently. I woul be glad to share my experiences with the group and help those who would like to transition into leadership roles.</p>"

South Bay Positive Psychology Salon,"<p>We all want to be happy, right? Are you interested in learning about what we know about thriving and achieving lasting happiness? Do you like the idea of exploring and achieving your full potential as a human being? Would you like to learn how to experience flow states and become more resilient in the face of life's obstacles?</p>
<p>If so, this is the right group for you! Each week Julie will lead a group discussion about a topic in positive psychology and personal development. This group is a place to learn how to thrive and also teach each other the methods that have worked for you. Positive psychology has three foundational areas of development: positive emotions, positive traits, and positive community engagement. * Positive emotions lead to a pleasant life experience. Germaine to this are things like development of contentment with your past, happiness in the here and now, and hope for your future. *Developing your positive individual traits will help you to lead a more engaged life and experience flow states (which are awesome!). To experience more of this we will explore our strengths and virtues, such as our capacity to love and be productive, and our potential to develop our full potential to be courageous, compassionate, resilient, creative, curious, in integrity, self-knowledgable, moderate, self-controlled, and wise. *Using our strengths to benefit our community and the world gives life meaning and purpose. We can develop our potential in this area by studying what meaning and purpose mean to us as individuals and how we can strive to use our strengths to improve our communities through our efforts in such areas as as social justice, personal responsibility, kindness &amp; compassion, parenting, nurturance of others, modeling a strong work ethic, developing out leadership abilities, promoting teamwork, building purpose, and sharing tolerance.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you and working together to discover where our potential can lead us!</p>

Tap into Magic In Your Biz And Life,"<p>Tap Into Magic is a group of fantastic Bay Area folks who are interested in learning more about Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT).</p>

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>
<p>Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.</p>
<p>You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.<span><br></span></p>

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,"<p>This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! <b>Visit <a href=""http://eatlikeagoddess.com"">Eat LIke A Goddess now</a> for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body.</b></p>"

Exploring the Tools of Energy Psychology to Change Your Life,"<p>Energy Psychology (EP) consists of a number of holistic modalities that use a mind-body-spirit approach to healing. The premise is that any illness or dis-ease has physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components and that all of them need to be addressed for deep and complete healing to occur. On a basic level, everything is made of energy, including our bodies, so when imbalances or blockages in the energy flow occur they can result in any number of issues or problems, such as stress, anxiety, depression and more. EP tools are designed to identify and remove those blockages so that the body-mind-spirit can heal itself.</p>
<p>This group is for those seeking more information about healing using these innovative tools. Some of them can be used for self-healing, others are for working with a therapist or other health professional. My intention is to provide an overview of what's out there beyond the traditional tools of western psychology, open to anyone who's interested.</p>
<p>I have another Meetup group called the Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology, SF chapter (<a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Association-for-Comprehensive-Energy-Psychology-SF-Chapter/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.meetup.com/Association-for-Comprehensive-Energy-Psychology-SF-Chapter/</a>), which is dedicated toward health professionals who would like to know more about, or who are already using these tools in their practices.</p>"

Lodi EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) Meetup,"<p>This is a group for Middle School Student, Parents and Teachers interested in learning EFT Tapping to reduce common anxiety and stress in school or at home. Tapping is simple and fun self-help technique that is easy to learn even for complete beginners. I started this group because as an EFT Practitioner I have discovered the basis of most negative emotions stem from our experiences during middle school's critical life changing time. I want to offer middle school students an opportunity to learn this simple technique to feel calmer and in-control of their emotions. Simply put, It literally helps you feel better.</p>"
Walnut Creek Energy Healing With EFT Meetup,"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in energy healing, experiencing more joy, success and abundance without all the effort.

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>"
Speak English Clearly: Master American Communication,"<p>If you're a non-native English speaker in the U.S. and want to improve your American English accent and communication skills, then come join our group!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Whether you're interviewing for a job or internship or already have one, you may find that successful 2-way communication with Americans can be tricky.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you ever feel uncertain or nervous speaking up, presenting your ideas, or find it hard to have meaningful, productive conversations at work, this is the group for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As your communication coach, I will guide you through the American English language conventions and American cultural norms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a relaxed, friendly space, we'll create a great community and support each other&nbsp;while refining your skills.</span></p>
<p><span>Come and bring a friend! &nbsp;The more, the merrier. =)</span> <br></p>"

Bay Area Procrastinator Mutual Help Group,"<p>Are you a procrastinator chronically and deeply afflicted by procrastination and lack of efficiency? Me too.

Ladies Meet over a Meal,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>There are so many of us out here in the San Francisco and Bay Area; we all have different interests, different backgrounds and skills, as well as different preferences in what we eat.  Since I love eating and figure many others do too, I thought it would be fun to use the lunch hours to bring us all together.  Whether you want to try new restaurants, meet some new, exciting, and different people, or simply just build your connections... I invite you to join us for some of our lunches.  Most lunches would be in restaurants around the downtown, north beach, and financial district area during the weekdays.  Right now, I am looking into Fridays, but feel free to give me suggestions of restaurants or days that may work better for you. <br />Look forward to meeting many of you!</p>

Sacramento Business Social Network Group,"<p><strong>LOOKING TO GENERATE MORE REFERRAL BUSINESS?</strong><br>

<br>

The Sacramento Business Social Network Group is a local community of business owners and professionals whose members actively work to refer and generate business for one another.<br>

<br>

Through regular meetings and activities our members help you find new clients and grow your business.<br>

<br>

<strong>WHAT IS A SOCIAL NETWORK GROUP? HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong><br>

<br>

We are primarily a group of business people looking to meet new clients and referral sources during social events. We have found that quick meet and greet style networking events are not nearly as effective as creating long lasting relationships with other professionals. We are committed to building a strong core of 30-40 regular attendees with a constant ebb and flow of new-comers to meet.</p>
<p>Business types represented include: realtors, mortgage brokers, contractors, web designers, consultants, financial planners, accountants, software developers, recruiters, HR consultants, business development professionals, CPAs, corporate trainers, carpet cleaners, landscapers, architects, attorneys, chiropractors and countless others. These members work to actively cross-refer and refer business to one another in their daily communications with customers and prospects.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>"

Women Partnering in Business East Bay,"<p>Please join us as we collaborate and create dynamic business partnerships between professional women in the San Francisco East Bay region.

Our group is not category specific, nor are there monthly attendance requirements.

We will alternate between lunch events and evening happy hours. &nbsp;At the lunches, there will be time for networking and everyone will have a short time to introduce yourself and your business. The evening events are an informal time to get to know each other and our businesses in a less structured format. Please bring business cards, flyers or any other promotional materials you wish to either event.</p>"
Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

FEMININE PROSPERITY Meetup Group,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>I created this group because I have found that women thrive when they are an integral part of a loving, supportive, emotionally healthy community.</p>
<p>We've heard many spiritual teachers, and now scientists as well, telling us that we really do create our own reality. But we have been programmed from our earliest years with lies about who we are and what we are capable of doing and being. In order to reverse that programming from our parents, our schools, our media and our entire society, we need a lot of support. We need a community consisting of loving people who take 100% responsibility for their lives and challenge you to do the same. We need a clear system to follow which teaches us how to dance with the Law of Attraction in a way that really works. Through exciting, transformational events, supportive meetings and fun activities, we are committed to keeping our vibration HIGH as much of the time as possible. Feeling wonderful, laughing, loving, creating ordinary miracles attracts more of the same! Come join us on our wild joyride!</p>
<p>If you'd like to understand what I mean by ""Feminine Prosperity,""&nbsp;</p>

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,"<p>This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! <b>Visit <a href=""http://eatlikeagoddess.com"">Eat LIke A Goddess now</a> for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body.</b></p>"

Dream Priestess(TM) Circle - Bay Area Women,"<p><span>The Dream Priestess(TM) Circle is a women's gathering where you can explore everyday magic. You will awaken and deepen your spiritual gifts (e.g. intuition), step into your spiritual power as a leader, and play with new ways of accessing spiritual guidance.</span> <br></p>
<p>Whether you're experienced with your spiritual gifts, or just discovering you have them, join us for creative exploration and fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatherings are at my home and there's room for about 10 women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

The San Francisco LGBT Professionals,"<p><span>There is a need for events with pre-screened professionals, in settings that facilitate social interaction, and provide entertainment in an organized manner in the San Francisco Bay Area. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As professionals we recognize the value of these events, and the costs involved. &nbsp;Therefore this is a PAID group, of $5 per month, which we encourage to be paid quarterly ($15), or yearly ($45). &nbsp;This does NOT cover our costs, but helps pay fees to MeetUp and weeds out people who join many groups, but never participate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dues can be paid via Meetup (WePay) or in person with cash or credit card (Square).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We do require members (1) give their real name (at least first name), (2) an appropriate picture of themselves in their profile (suitable for recognizing you at events), (3) regularly attend events and be involved with the group, (4) pay dues. </span></p>
<p><span>Events are organized based on member interest and feedback. &nbsp;Please be sure to fill out the Poll Questions to participate.</span><br></p>
<p><span>We ask you pay for guests you bring to events (fees will be posted).</span></p>

Due to the increasing number of American who have lived in Asia or like Asian culture and the increasing number of Asian who are now living in the US, a mutual interest in Asian/American love relationships is also growing. These men and women consider themselves bi-cultural and are seeking a partner who can share and understand their bi-cultural values, interests and experiences.

AUMA,"<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>AUMA stands for the Adult Use Marijuana Act that was passed in 2016. Which is great milestone for the 420 friends, community and cannabis culture in general.However, there are skeptics of the equability of the cannabis industry. The economics of marijuana include the billions of tax revenue dollars that will pour into California. As marijuana advocates continue to push for reform Sacramento's underrepresented communities struggle to rebuild and anticipate the fate of gentrification. Economic and social justice is an inclusive concept. Many people of color strive to be heard. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>Currently, I am working on a film about drug war reparations as they pertain to the cannabis industry. The purpose is to open a dialogue about the upcoming for-profit cannabis industry in 2018. In addition, the documentary will propose shared cannabis equity with underrepresented communities; specifically African American women. I also want to reach out to African American women that would like to share their personal experiences and perspectives on film. All feminist are welcome to join and share your feminist voice on this matter. There will be upcoming sister circle discussions, guest speakers that include activist, educators, and community leaders. I look forward to connecting with you in creating and filming this movement.</p>

<p>We meet in cafes or bookstores in the Mountain View/Palo Alto area. &nbsp;Our go-to for the monthly book meeting is Books Inc, 301 Castro St, Mountain View- their staff have been very accommodating! &nbsp;You can buy our monthly books from our book club webpage on their website, http://www.booksinc.net/politcally-inspired-book-club</p>
<p>The environment we hold for our discussions is open and compassionate. Recognizing and honoring the different beliefs and political viewpoints, and seeking best to understand and explore. Six principles for dialogue:</p>
<p>6 principles common to most dialogue and circle groups guide the conversations: <br> . Suspend judgment as best you can <br> . Respect one another <br> . Seek to understand rather than persuade <br> . Invite and honor diversity of opinion <br> . Speak what has personal heart and meaning <br> . Go for honesty and depth without going on and on</p>

<p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all? Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? These are the most important questions of our time, and how we answer them will determine the future of our country.</p>

Concord SB-18 Listening Session: Children's Bill of Rights,"<p>Common Sense Kids Action has been working to make kids our state and nation's top priority. We need a vision to accomplish this goal, one that defines what every child in California has the right to expect, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, immigration status, or ability. And then we will need to hold our elected officials -- and ourselves -- accountable for making it happen. That's where we need YOU. The Bill of Rights for Children and Youth outlines the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and family supports we believe are necessary for all children to succeed and thrive. SB 18 will serve as a rallying point for a statewide conversation about what we must do to help our kids.</p> 
<p>Common Sense Kids Action is collaborating with Senator Pan to host conversations statewide with parents and children's advocates like you. Input from those conversations will be used to add important details to the framework of SB 18 that help shape this important vision. Please join us.</p>"

RTS Sexual Violence Prevention and Survivor Support,"<p>Rape Trauma Services of San Mateo County strives to eliminate all forms of violence, with a special focus on sexual assault and abuse. Informed by our understanding of traumatic experiences and cycles of violence, we facilitate healing and the prevention of violence through the provision of counseling, advocacy, and education. We promote and adopt policies, practices, and the social values rooted in fairness, equity and inclusiveness. <br>Learn more about us at www.rapetraumaservices.org</p>
<p>We invite anyone in the community interested in learning, sharing and/or taking an active role in preventing sexual violence and supporting people who have been affected by sexual violence to join our group.</p>"
Volunteer Queer!,"<p>A meetup for queer folks and allies who want to volunteer with LGBTQ+ nonprofits! Meet new people and work with the organizations and activists that support our community every day. We'll meet up for volunteer activities once a month (or more, as needed!), and hang out after!</p>"
Peninsula Feminist Book Club,"<p>Hello Feminists,</p>
<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>
<p> <br></p>"
Safe Places - Social Activism,"<p>Are you a protective person? Do you believe in the the Dream of Martin Luther King Jr? Are you unwilling to sit by while fellow community members are being beaten in the streets and hospitalized for their political beliefs? Do you want your children growing up in a country where they are free to think and express their opinions without fear of violent repercussions? Let's meet up to discuss nonviolent political activism, brainstorm together about what we can do to turn the tide here in the Bay Area, and get out there and DO something!</p>"
Trees for Oakland,"<p>We plant trees in Oakland where people ask us to -- along streets, at parks, at schools, and more -- especially in the parts of town that need trees the most. Join us if you want to use your muscles and your mind to help make Oakland a (literally) greener place. For more info, go to <a href=""http://TreesForOakland.org"">TreesForOakland.org</a> . <br></p>"
SGI USA Nichiren Buddhists of Santa Cruz County,"<p>Welcome! We are a worldwide movement of people connected by Nichiren Buddhism which promotes peace, culture, and education through personal transformation and social contribution. We have a shared commitment to realize a world free of nuclear weapons with a sustainable environment; and a world in which social justice prevails and all human lives are valued equally.</p>
<p>This is Buddhism in Action for Peace!</p>"
San Jose WILPF (Women's Intl League for Peace & Freedom),"<p>Wilpf San Jose is for anyone who wants to work today for peace and freedom, human rights, women's rights, and more with an organization whose founding goes back to 1915.</p>"
Oakland Cure for Capitalism,"<p>This meetup seeks a practical end to wage slavery, oppression, and capitalism, and a fulfilling life for each of us along the way.</p> 
<p>We wonder why there's so much work to be done to help the masses while most capital goes towards consolidating capital further. We battle mental illness, feelings of alienation, underemployment, and hopelessness, but have a sneaking feeling that we aren't really the problem. We've had ""good jobs"" but can't seem to shake the feeling of being ground down. We're ready for a different way. &lt;br&gt;</p>"

Bay Area Women of Color Hiking Group,"<p>This a group for WOC (Women of Color) hikers in the Bay Area. This includes cis, gay, straight, non-binary and trans women, and anyone who identifies as a women of color.</p>
<p>I started this group to meet other outdoorsy women of color who like to hike! Being an avid hiker and backpacker, I have often found that POCs (and especially WOC) aren't well-represented in the outdoors, and I'd like to do what I can to change that by giving WOC a safe space to hike and experience the outdoors.</p>
<p>If you also like happy hours and brunch, and discussing current events/social justice (and maybe even discussing current events/social justice over happy hour or brunch), we'll probably do some of that too!</p>
<p>Hikes will take place primarily in Marin, Peninsula, East and South Bay. &nbsp;All skill levels welcome.</p>

AUMA,"<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>AUMA stands for the Adult Use Marijuana Act that was passed in 2016. Which is great milestone for the 420 friends, community and cannabis culture in general.However, there are skeptics of the equability of the cannabis industry. The economics of marijuana include the billions of tax revenue dollars that will pour into California. As marijuana advocates continue to push for reform Sacramento's underrepresented communities struggle to rebuild and anticipate the fate of gentrification. Economic and social justice is an inclusive concept. Many people of color strive to be heard. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>Currently, I am working on a film about drug war reparations as they pertain to the cannabis industry. The purpose is to open a dialogue about the upcoming for-profit cannabis industry in 2018. In addition, the documentary will propose shared cannabis equity with underrepresented communities; specifically African American women. I also want to reach out to African American women that would like to share their personal experiences and perspectives on film. All feminist are welcome to join and share your feminist voice on this matter. There will be upcoming sister circle discussions, guest speakers that include activist, educators, and community leaders.

SoOakland Collective,"<p>Hello, I am Shayla Jamerson. Founder of SoOakland. A organization I started 2 years ago to change the perspective of how Black Oakland was viewed. I created events that are safe spaces for the Black and Brown community as well as the natives. As a native of Oakland its disheartening what is happening int he city as far as gentrification is concerned. I appreciate the face lift that is happening but I do not appreciate people not being able to feel like this is home anymore. Anyways my group allows us to come together, network, have fun, travel, party, find out what other dope things are happening in the Bay Area, join forces, appreciate each others value through brotherhood and sisterhood experiences. This group is about representing what REAL OAKLAND and REAL BAYAREA</p>"
"Civil Rights History Discussion Group, SF","<p>In this group we'll dive deep into the many dimensions of the struggle for racial justice in twentieth-century America, and we'll have a helluva lot of fun while we do it! Over drinks, each month we'll discuss something fascinating from the spectrum of racial justice history - armed resistance; nonviolence; profound strategy; successes and failures; deep context; multiracial alliance building; nefarious tactics of divisiveness; histories of whiteness and structural and strategic racism; radical women and powerful youth; the profound legacy of LGBT figures in black and brown freedom struggles; grassroots mobilizations... This will be all about learning deeply about important issues, while having excellent conversations and building community. <br></p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Structure</p>
<p>- This will be about everyone's voice being present, as long as they wish it to be... about everyone being able to express their ideas, ask their questions, be fully heard, and engage in meaningful dialog. There will be a facilitator, but we should practice the good ol' step up/step back. <br></p>
<p>- The readings each month will be somewhere between 10 to 20 pages; so it will be very accessible to folks with busy lives.&nbsp; However, it will be deep.&nbsp; Please read the material if you plan on attending.&nbsp; If you start but don't quite make it through, no worries, please come! <br></p>
<p>- As you read, think of these three things: What parts of the story most interest you? Is there anything you feel confusion about or want more clarity around? Are their connections you can draw between the story and the present moment? Considering these three things as you read will ensure especially awesome conversations! <br></p>
<p>- If the struggle for racial justice is something you have deep knowledge about and feel absolutely comfortable talking about, bring your wisdom! If this subject is new to you and it feels super heavy and you feel a little uneasy talking about it but you know its important and you want to figure it out, this is the perfect place for you too!&nbsp; We'll help you build up your knowledge and develop your voice, and we'll have fun.&nbsp; Let's make this a space for helping one another along the path; wherever we are on the path. <br></p>

Guiding Deserving but  Uninformed  Local Americans in career,"<p>We are going to help local Americans who want to do better in their life <br>Who deserve to make better living , to do better jobs , make better money, <br>who are struggling to make a good life in the most resourceful country called America.</p>
<p>Odd surprise is that they are struggling badly because of absence of system in place to help local people from here to make better choices in education and career.</p>
<p>United states have been the birth place ( incubator ) of latest technological innovations; information technology; and many inventions. <br>To continue its leading position, however it is dependent on human talent from outside countries. <br>The paradox is that this heavy dependence exists at the same time when there are many many local Americans ( youngsters &amp; mature individuals) <br>who are deserving but are not fully informed / Aware <br>who are bright but are directionless <br>in making right choices for education and career. What we will do : <br>We will guide them to take better decisions in education and professional life. More importantly, we are also goingt to network with large corporates and research organistions to create some special opportunities for our members and overall local americans. I have written articles and discussed with many colleagues, students &amp; parents. I have received unanimous support; strong endorsements and encouragement from people of senior director level to Analysts, <br>employees of Facebook, google <br>working class people to rich families, <br>church going parents to bar going adults; <br>religious aristocrats to people who believe in marijuana.</p>
<p>We will discuss the 8 reasons fro spreading the awareness : historical , cultural , economical, personal , psychological, financial, Capitalisitc, commercial. We will propose solutions and the methods to implement with right people. We will get the results.</p>"

Immigration Options for Researchers,"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in learning about EB-1 green cards, particularly Researchers, Professors, Executives, &amp; Entrepreneurs. We'll have a series of 4 to 5 meetings where we'll discuss the following fast-track green cards: EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability), EB-1B (Outstanding Researchers/Professors), and EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver). We'll also discuss the O-1 visa, which is a great alternative to an H-1B for researchers and other top performers.</p> 
<p>Do you have to have a Nobel Prize to qualify? (Spoiler...no, you don't.) How strong is your case? When, if at all, will international travel be limited during the green card process? Is the EB-1 Priority Date really backlogged for India and China?</p>

The Magic Money Tree Project,"<p>What most people know about money is wrong and this is creating massive societal problems.&nbsp; The goal of the Magic Money Tree Project is to build grassroots literacy of political economics (how political and economic systems interact).&nbsp; We create, share, and disseminate educational tools and materials to build literacy on key societal issues.&nbsp; We work on a grassroots level to understand the issues real people face in their daily lives. We help build understanding of how political and economic systems work in ways that are relevant and understandable to them.</p>
<p>This project's goal is not to promote a specifically liberal or conservative agenda.&nbsp; Liberals and conservatives both contribute to society.&nbsp; We count them among our friends, family, members of the community, countrymen, and fellows in humanity.&nbsp; We can improve society by learning to understand people different from us because we all have shared interests and goals.</p>
<p>This project is also not directly concerned with party politics.&nbsp; However, understanding political economy opens up new possibilities for policy and political action.</p>"

San Francisco Justice for All,"<p>Launch a Ballot Initiative to prohibit California from budgeting for the State's Public Defenders Offices. California jails have become a big business, discriminating against specific minority groups and economic classes. California's state and county governments consistently starve the Public Defender's Offices for funds so the Prosecutors Office can get the convictions and plea bargains they want. It's not fair for the defense to be controlled by the same boss as the prosecutor. If California refuses to pay for the Public Defenders Offices then the Federal Government will have no choice but to step in. Let's make it happen through a Ballot Initiative for a California Constitutional Amendment. More money and independent leadership for the state's Public Defenders Offices will be an important step towards the American promise of freedom and justice for all.</p>"

<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>

<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>

Wicca Wimmin's Moon Ritual of Marin,"<p>Blessed Be Sister! This is a Wiccan Full Moon Ritual of Pagan Goddess Worship for women, to celebrate our femininity and nurture our souls. This Sister Circle loosely follows Starhawk's style in her book The Spiral Dance. We will call in the four directions, invoke the Goddess, join our energies and raise up the cone of power to bless the world, each other, the cauldron and ourselves. The Ritual is very inclusive and you may bring things to put on the altar, or put in the cauldron to be blessed. Bring your drums and magic tools, and anything that honors the Goddess, wimmin, and your natural yin. This is a celebration of our womanhood, free of the male dynamic, for our spirits to be strengthened in total safety, &nbsp;and our souls healed. Join and enjoy as we honor each other's natural womanhood, to consciously align our selves with Mother Nature's cycles. The Full Moon energy is for fullfillment of life, love, health and all goodness. Ritual is followed by a vegetarian pot luck.</p>
<p>Brothers, men, do not join this group. &nbsp;You will be banned. Please, give your invasive and disrespectful bothers a pull up and tell them to honor our boundary. If you are genuinely interested in Wicca, read The Spiral Dance by Starhawk, and join my meetup Wicca and Witchcraft Training, then you may call me, Reverend Joey Talley, at 415.990.6020&nbsp;</p>"

Starting Over Now - A Women's Group,"<p>In these turbulent times many women find themselves in a place of having to start over for various reasons: after marriages or relationships have broken up, children have left the home, illness or distress has changed their life. All these issues can create huge emotional, spiritual, and physical pain in your life. This group will help you find not only new people that have endured your situation but a place to be safe and find some ideas on how to adapt. Change is hard but it is in the difficulties that we find our true spirit. Join this group that meets the first Friday of the month.</p>"

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>"

<p><span>We believe in physical strength, but also the inner strength of great women.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in a caring and nurturing community, where all women are free to be themselves - safe to admit their weaknesses, safe to take on new challenges, and safe to explore the boundaries of life without men.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in fostering the independent, strong woman inside of every one of us.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in having a damn good time whether it's ""roughing it"" in a fabulous mountain house and hitting up the spa, or car camping and checking out the local hot springs, or 10-days in the backcountry without a shower.</span></p>

Santa Cruz Women Hiking,"<p>Dear fellow hikers or potential hikers,</p>
<p>I love hiking in the fresh air of mountain and sea, and want to join with other women in exploring hiking trails in Santa Cruz and neighboring counties. My goal is to get good exercise, enjoy good company, and experience the serenity and inspiration of the great outdoors.</p>
<p>Most of the hikes I will organize will be in the 3- to 7- mile range with a gain of 200 to 2000 feet. &nbsp;There are other organizers, however, who may do longer and/or more difficult hikes. If you're not ready to do the longer steeper hikes, try the easier ones! You are also welcome to come and do a portion of a hike, then return on your own. That's how I got started!</p>
<p>This group is for women of any age, who love hiking in beautiful natural spaces, or who would like to give it a try! It's also a relaxed and easy way to make new friends :)</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the group or the hikes, feel free to send me an email.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Kitty</p>
<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p>I will do my best to describe the level of difficulty of each hike, so you can decide if the hike is right for you. I'll use the descriptions below to indicate how much uphill there is. In addition to the uphill, please take into consideration how long the hike is. A hike may be described as moderately easy, but if it's 6 or 7 miles long, that distance may be too much for you at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Moderately easy</strong> = Up and down, but total elevation gain of less than 400 feet. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> = Total gain 400 to 800 feet. Lots of up and down. Can be steep stretches, but no really long steep uphill stretches. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderately difficult</strong> = Total gain greater than 800 feet. May be some really steep sections and/or very long stretches of uphill. <br></p>"

Girl Develop It San Jose,"<p>Women Developers and Programmers!<br>

 Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.</p>
<p><br>

 It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask ""stupid questions.""</p>
<p><br>

 We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>
<p><br>

Embodied Voice for Relationships,"<p>If you want more depth in your relationships, this is the right group for you. Whether you are in a partnership right now or you're single, come and learn how to create an even deeper level of intimacy in all the relationships in your life. This includes professional relationships, friendships, family dynamics and anything in between.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cornerstone to every relationship is communication and communication starts by using your voice to communicate your needs and desires. The problem is, most people don't know how to use their voice effectively, so even when you say exactly what you want, your partner doesn't hear you. Frustrating when that happens, isn't it? What would it be like if you could communicate your desires clearly and effectively <b>and</b>&nbsp;have your partner fulfill those desires? That is not only possible, we're here to show you how you can create this reality in your life.</p>
<p>Learning to speak from your body allows you not only to be heard - you will be felt in a way you have probably never experienced before. Learn how to use your voice to attract and keep the relationships you desire in your life. Find your authentic voice, and notice how much different it sounds than the way you currently sound when you speak. Feel the power of your own voice in a way you have yet to experience. Isn't it time for you to create the amazing relationships you have always wanted? Join us, and make these dreams a reality.</p>"
Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

FEMININE PROSPERITY Meetup Group,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>I created this group because I have found that women thrive when they are an integral part of a loving, supportive, emotionally healthy community.</p>
<p>We've heard many spiritual teachers, and now scientists as well, telling us that we really do create our own reality. But we have been programmed from our earliest years with lies about who we are and what we are capable of doing and being. In order to reverse that programming from our parents, our schools, our media and our entire society, we need a lot of support. We need a community consisting of loving people who take 100% responsibility for their lives and challenge you to do the same. We need a clear system to follow which teaches us how to dance with the Law of Attraction in a way that really works. Through exciting, transformational events, supportive meetings and fun activities, we are committed to keeping our vibration HIGH as much of the time as possible. Feeling wonderful, laughing, loving, creating ordinary miracles attracts more of the same! Come join us on our wild joyride!</p>
<p>If you'd like to understand what I mean by ""Feminine Prosperity,""&nbsp;</p>

Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles,"<p>Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles are for women who want a safe, shame-free space to discuss sexuality. &nbsp;We share our stories, gain strength from each other, learn about our bodies, discuss orgasm, sexual preferences, sexual styles, body image, sexual shame &amp; trauma, and heal any wounds we may have around our sexual experiences. &nbsp;We will gain insight from HomePlay exercises specifically designed to empower us as women on this transformational journey.</p>
<p>LOTUS blooms as:</p>
<p>Loving Ourselves Fully</p>
<p>Opening to Orgasm</p>
<p>Trusting Our Authentic Expressions</p>
<p>Union with Self, Beloved &amp; Divine</p>
<p>Surrendering to Satisfaction</p>
<p>In Opening the LOTUS circles we explore each one of these themes through story telling, group activities, diad work, online instruction and sex education.</p>
<p>The Lotus Flower has long been used in eastern spirituality to symbolize female sexuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Taken from</span><a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com""> mythencyclopedia.com</a></p>
<p><i>""In Asian mythology the lotus often symbolizes the female sexual organs, from which new life is born. Lotuses appear in both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Hindus refer to the god Brahma as ""lotus-born "" for he is said to have emerged from a lotus that was the navel, or center, of the universe. The lotus is also the symbol of the goddess Padma, who appears on both Hindu and Buddhist monuments as a creative force.</i></p>
<p><i>The holiness of the flower is illustrated by the legend that when the Buddha walked on the earth he left lotuses in his trail instead of footprints. One myth about the origin of Buddha relates that he first appeared floating on a lotus. According to a Japanese legend, the mother of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Nichiren.html"">Nichiren</a>&nbsp;(Lotus of the Sun) became pregnant by dreaming of sunshine on a lotus. Nichirin founded a branch of Buddhism in the 1200s. The phrase ""Om mani padme hum,"" which both Hindus and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Buddhism.html"">Buddhists</a>&nbsp;use in meditation, means ""the jewel in the lotus"" and can refer to the Buddha or to the mystical union of male and female energies"".</i></p>
<p>Opening the LOTUS as Love, Orgasm, Trust, Union &amp; Surrender encourages us as women to step into our full, authentic, freely expressed sexual selves.</p>

Mona Lisa's Smile,"Do you actually enjoy sex or want to? Are you ready to own your sexuality? Reclaim it, heal it and celebrate it? Women need a safe space in which to heal, explore, examine and learn about their sexuality. This is a group for women to talk openly and freely about women's sexuality, sexual exploration, shaking up the social norms, and ignoring social taboos. So much of our popular culture is built on the idea that sex is for men. That men are the pursuers of sex, and women are the prize to be had. That women only ""give up"" sex to men in exchange for love and commitment, and that women who give it up too easily are, at best, fools who don't know how to broker good deals for ourselves. The idea of women as the sexual gatekeepers, the natural wielders of ""no,"" is so strongly embedded in our culture that women who enthusiastically say ""yes!"" because we actually like sex are profoundly threatening."
Opportunity to diversify: Women entrepreneurs,"I am a busy professional working on a business opportunity in my spare-time.

<p><span>We believe in showing up as you are, that </span><a>play</a><span> isn't just for kids, that we all still have a lot to learn, that when we move - we can move mountains, that it really does take a village, and that nothing can replace the feeling of connecting with women who&nbsp;really see </span><span>you</span><span>.</span><br></p>
<p><span>Note: If you do not have a profile picture or are a male (sorry, this group is just for the gals), you will be removed. It's all love and our goal is to cultivate a culture of safety. Thank you for understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>"
Create The Life and Business You Love,"<p>Create the life and business you really love. Inspiring heart centred professionals to stand up and shine. No more stressed out, burned out, bored or brain dead. <br></p>
<p>As a coach, and meditation instructor who has given thousands of 1-on-1 sessions to private clients and run many groups around the world, I find that many professionals that I work with, have anxiety about going out alone, they need to define their authentic leadership role, and they have difficulty trusting they are choosing the right path for them.</p>

<p>In our culture, we are conditioned and programmed from birth with the script of the dominators of our culture. In this community we bond, grow, learn, unlearn, celebrate life. As a result of our conditioning from our society and our biological families, we act in ways and create a life that is counter to our own and our collective benefit. Through presentations, instruction, practices, video, creative expression, group exercises, healing practices, love, play, and emotion in safe created space, we will allow our spirit, our soul, our minds and our physical body to return to our essential state (to our essence) in connection to all (rather than in isolation).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we speak of personal growth we are creating a life that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - More and more Conscious<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Living a life toward Meaning<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - being Considerate of the effects our thoughts, emotions, choices and actions have on ourselves, others, the world<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Acknowledging the connection between ourselves and everything everyone and everything that appears not us<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are a group of women committed to taking an intentional journey of growth together, waking up, bonding, learning to love, making deep connection, real community, calling on one another, celebrating together and becoming a community.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Community Home is ""Demeter's Magical Sanctuary"": Healing rooms, educational center, nature retreat, holistic and spiritual lifestyle learning, community.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This community is for all those who self define as women.

Consideration of others. Do what is true and right for oneself and do right by others. Camaraderie, support, love, growth and connection and community are our goals. We look to build someone up not tear them down. We will discuss shadow (or unhealthy patterns), but in a loving supportive manner, and we will practice healthy patterns. Personal antagonistic attack will not be tolerated. Each one teach one. Humility allows growth, defensiveness prevents it. Change is life and life is change.

Goddess Painting Class,"Paint your OWN sacred icon of the Divine Feminine, *even if you've NEVER painted before!* This class is a supportive, welcoming environment for artists and NON-artists alike to paint the Goddess in her many forms. Led by Katie Ketchum and Jennifer Mantle and based on Shiloh Sophia's Color of Woman method, we gather once a month to feed your spirit and guide you through creating a personal icon from beginning to end. The Color of Woman method was developed by Shiloh to enable you to create a painting you love without any prior knowledge or skill. Jennifer and Katie both thought they could never paint- and now not only teach but have had solo shows of their own work and routinely sell paintings! Classes take place in sacred space and begin with an opening and connecting to the Goddess we are working with that month, and then step-by-step instruction with live demo. This is a criticism-free zone. We are all about empowering and supporting each participant. Open to all, including men, GNC folks, kids, everyone. We also maintain an optional, private Facebook group that you're welcome to join upon taking a class. We would love to see you! Everything included in the class fee of $35, though if you wish to use a larger canvas than those we provide (which are typically around 9"" x 11"") and any favorite paints/brushes, feel free to do so. Kindly avoid the use of scented products."

Dream Priestess(TM) Circle - Bay Area Women,"<p><span>The Dream Priestess(TM) Circle is a women's gathering where you can explore everyday magic. You will awaken and deepen your spiritual gifts (e.g. intuition), step into your spiritual power as a leader, and play with new ways of accessing spiritual guidance.</span> <br></p>
<p>Whether you're experienced with your spiritual gifts, or just discovering you have them, join us for creative exploration and fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatherings are at my home and there's room for about 10 women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

Our newsletter has updates on club activities, summaries of the meetings, the meeting packets (with lots of great info and tips), info on Bay area protests and rallies, links to fascinating news &amp; opinion articles I recommend, and some good new items to celebrate! <br>We also have a secret Facebook group where we post relevant articles for discussion. <br>You can check out our website at: www.thepinkhatresistance.com</p>"

Reproductive Justice Reading Group,"<p>We are a reading group dedicated to understanding how our culture oppresses women by controlling their reproductive lives. Issues to be discussed include access to sex education, contraception and abortion, as well as reproductive healthcare, parental leave, and affordable childcare. We will also discuss social pressures to have or not have children, silence around abortion, miscarriage and infertility, and pressures upon women to engage in ever-more ""intensive mothering."" We will explore these issues from a variety of perspectives, acknowledging that that they impact women of different racial identities, classes, and sexual identities in different ways. We also acknowledge that different groups of women have vastly different histories of experiencing reproductive oppression.</p>"
