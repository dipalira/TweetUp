I believe there are a lot of us who love bacon, think the US Constitution rocks, don't care to compost or shop for \"fair trade\" cleaning products that don't clean well compared to the awesome ones capitalism provided, and know that funny is funny.

Yet, it is wholly acceptable to openly disparage and cast out Republicans, Capitalists, Libertarians, Evangelical Christians, Carnivores, Constitutionalist, Gun Rights activists, and anyone who doesn't wish to \"celebrate\" all the crap they embrace and therefore be deem \"acceptable\" in their eyes.</p>\n<p>Listen, we think the progressives are probably wrong and that their way of living/thinking has totally hosed up this state. We know for certain they are driving away the producing class and forcing heroes into hiding due to their militant intolerance and fervent redistribution of wealth (math is hard for some, but the numbers are indisputable). But, we will defend their right to be wrong AND suffer the consequences of your wrongness. With great liberty comes great responsibility, after all. </p>\n<p>Just let us RELAX and socialize in peace and talk amongst ourselves. Let us discuss our love for America and acknowledge some fine examples of American greatness, without the condemnation and pious looks of disdain we experience at every turn in Oak Park, River Forest, Forest Park, and Elmwood Park. </p>\n<p>If you are a Liberty refugee from Chicago or other surrounding suburbs, you are welcome to join in here.
