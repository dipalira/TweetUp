How we can use the practice of yoga to address mental distress and create safety in the body and mind.
Getting on the mat and working with the poses.
This workshop will include movement, breathwork, lecture, and conversation. All levels are welcome! The structure of the day is as follows:
1). A shorter. all-levels yoga practice
 2) Exploration of current psychological research on how the body can affect the mind (and vice versa)
3) Examination of the nervous system and its role in depression and anxiety
4) A 45 minute lunch break
5) Learning postures, movements, and breath that address anxiety and depression respectively 6) Embodied practice of these techniques
7) An introduction to assessing your mind/body needs, and how to choose what tools to address them. Cost is $79 Early Bird and $99 after June 2nd. A portion of the proceeds go to support the Against the Stream Mediation Center (www.againstthestream.com).
Candace has studied with Bessel van der Kolk and Bo Forbes, as well as her primary teacher, Shiva Rae, and this work is deeply inspired by them. She also draws extensively from her Master's in Clinical & Counseling Psychology, and her time working as a trauma-specialized therapist. She has been teaching yoga for 8 years in Philadelphia as well as at festivals, workshops and retreats throughout the world. You can find out more about Candace at:

Oakland Bipolar Disorder Meetup,3,A place for people with Bipolar Disorder to connect.
recreational support group for mental well-being.,3,"Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness. We ourselves are the most intuitive of our body, thoughts, and emotions. Together, by sharing fun, love, and understanding from the community, we can empower ourselves and learn to see our unique sensitivities as strengths."

Marin Depression Meetup,3,"This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.
Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.
Steve has presented an initial idea for forming smaller support groups.  The idea, and ongoing discussion about it can be found here: "
East Bay INFJs For Friendship (20s-30s),3,"East Bay INFJs For Friendship was founded to create relaxing and comfortable hang outs for INFJs from around the East Bay. Bonding over our NiFe traits and building quality friendships is our mission. Let's put in our warm efforts to make sure there will be plenty of support to go around.
Being an INFJ can be exhausting. There's a big brain and big heart in you, always fighting for control. You feel so much empathy and are so giving to others that sometimes, you need space to recharge and for folks to respect your personal bubble. 
You want others to understand that, even though you may be soft-spoken, your usual banter is just the tip of the iceberg, and there's a whole world of creativity and thoughtfulness inside waiting to be discovered by the right person. 
You find yourself a humanitarian and a skeptic.
You are extremely idealistic with a tragic twist. 
You are very logical but deeply emotional. 
You want to be freely expressive of your feelings and your complex thoughts without being misunderstood or judged.
You feel like a walking contradiction all the time and yet everything makes perfect sense.
You're at a loss to explain your philosophies to most people so a lot of the time you just listen.
Your empathy allows you to easily tune in to how others are feeling.
You are introverted and keep to yourself but crave a genuine bond.
You finally sum up your spirit to go out and mingle, and then when you're actually outside you want to come back home.
If you can relate to any of the above traits of INFJs, this is the group for you. With your inclusion, let's create a fun-filled, positive social environment for everyone to bond. Here we value respectful, kind friendships with our INFJs. 
If you're an INFJ who can relate to this description, please join this group and help make it an active, event-filled community!"
Perpetual Happiness Program,3,"For those who have struggled with mental health and gone through CBT/DBT training. This is a place for us to keep in touch, meet up, and provide each other supprt in a comfortable environment."
Sac's OneOfAKind,3,"Anyone who can join who wants a safe and friendly place that can help cope with their anxiety and depression. Coping can be playing video games, watching movie, painting, even a nice walk! Being able to open up with people that is going through the same exact thing. This group is help and support each other on the journey called life.  We can plan awesome activities to do also!"
Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,3,"This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.
The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.
We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.
Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good."
Discussion Group: Young and Anxious,3,"If you find life to be overwhelming more often than you'd want, this group may be of interest for you. This Meetup is intended to be a safe place to discuss and listen to other's who also suffer from anxiety caused by the overwhelming amount of decisions we are inevitably faced with. We will share experiences, advice, and food while aiming to rewire our brains to cope with anxiety."
Sober and Socially Awkward,3,"How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?
For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human.  I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. 
I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.
I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.
By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.
For 5 years, I have done it alone.  It fucking sucks.
The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. 
I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication.  This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.
"
San Jose Group to Overcome Shyness and Improve Communication,3,"All of the meetups for this group will take place at the local Church of Scientology, where I am a volunteer. You can be of any religion to come. You are not expected to change your religion here.
Are you too shy?
Do you want to communicate freely?
Do you want to have more self-confidence?
Join this group.
It is designed to be supportive of the various issues of life that we might struggle with, such as
how to meet people, how to express yourself, how to start romantic relationships, etc. Even public speaking! We will have meetups and free classes on these topics, and we will connect with each other, learn about each other, and help each other improve in life. We have meetups every week.I hope the result of your joining this group is that you will be able to be yourself fully, express yourself easily, and enjoy a better life.
For any questions, call 408-341-9760 To give you an example of how I got over my own shyness and communication difficulties, I had been searching for solutions since when I was a teenager. The one place I've observed where people actually learned effective communication tools, and where people really improved self-confidence and changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place. I choose this location deliberately. We all need all the help we can get to make our lives better, and this place is a good resource."
Mind Power Development Meetup,3,"This is a group for people who are interested in developing their mind power in a methodical and effective way.
I notice that the problems people have with their mind include difficulties with self-confidence, communication skills, lack of focus, and anxiety, so this group will target remedying these difficulties. If our members want to work on other difficulties or issues, we can do so by request as well.
I have been a counselor at a non-profit organization for over twenty years now, and I am particularly fond of some powerful tools which work on everybody but are not generally known or applied.
We'll do some serious self improvement in this group. I'll provide the framework for our members to meet and learn together. We'll have free weekly meetings at the Dianetics & Scientology Life Improvement Center in Sacramento, near Marconi and Watt. Hopefully we'll change some lives as a result of our activities.
If you are interested in using the power of your mind more effectively, join this group now. If you have any questions, feel free to call me (Tony, Group Organizer) at 916-519-5287."
Panic/Anxiety Disorder Support of Fair Oaks,3,"This is a group for anyone who suffers or suffered from panic/anxiety disorders and their friends and family. I'm a former panic attack sufferer, and now my son has panic attack disorder. He says talking about it helps calm him down. I'm trying to navigate these confusing waters with him. I thought maybe there are local people who just need someone to talk it over with them, and let them know others understand. We can share stories, coping strategies, and learn from and support one another."
East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,3,"Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.
*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears. I am open to suggestions for meetups including joint meetups with groups that would be sensitive to socially anxious people."
Gay Men's Social Anxiety Workshop,3,"Restarting SAFE and ENJOYABLE workshops addressing gay male SOCIAL ANXIETY.

Petaluma Depression Meetup,3,"This is a support group for those suffering, or know someone who is suffering, from anxiety, depression, or PTSD. This group is intended to offer a sense of community and solidarity for those who might feel they are alone in their struggles. Meetings will consist of sharing experiences with anxiety, depression, and PTSD; and activities that we might use to help get us through our bouts of anxiety, breathing exercises, and meditative practices. This is not a therapy group. There will be no licensed professionals, so there will be no cross-talk, cross analyses, or advice given about personal issues. The intention is to create a safe space for people suffering from anxiety, depression, or PTSD, either directly or indirectly, to express, find an outlet, and acquire a circle of support as they continue their own journey in overcoming their struggles."
East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,3,"Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.
This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. "
Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,3,"Ages 18+
This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.
I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge & information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on.

Oakland LifeFire Laughter Yoga,3,"Want to jumpstart your joy? Join us and get happified!
The global Laughter Yoga movement was started by Dr. Madan Kataria, an MD from India, in 1995. There are now over 6000 ""Laughter Clubs"" in over 70 countries around the world spreading peace and joy through laughter!  Laughter Yoga does not use the familiar ""Hatha Yoga"" poses or asanas. It is not based on humor or jokes, which are very subjective. Rather it combines playful, easy laughter exercises with yogic breathing and a final relaxation. And like yoga it IS a ""practice"", also called ""intentional laughter"", that taps into the mind-body connection to lift your mood, reduce stress, lower blood pressure and boost your immune system while you have fun. After laughing and playing with this fabulous group, you will leave energized and relaxed. How cool is that!
Oakland LIfefire Laughter Yoga was started in 2007 by Annie Goglia, a certified Laughter Yoga Teacher and Life Coach. Annie loves to share her laughter with others with an open heart. She was trained by the founder of Laughter Yoga, Dr. Kataria. In 2013, Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Liz Nichols joined her as co-leader. 
We are usually a mix of ""regulars"" and newcomers. Drop-ins are super-welcome. No mats needed. Adults and older teens of all levels of physically fitness are welcome. Wear comfortable clothing for easier laughing.

San Jose - Manjushri Lineage Buddhist Group,3,"Hello  LEARN, CONTEMPLATE, CULTIVATE and TRANSFORM.  Welcome to the meetup group ""Inner Peace & Happiness Buddhist Study and Meditation Group"". This is a wonderful opportunity, whether you are just beginning or have been studying for awhile, to join other warm-heart, sincere Buddhist Practitioners as we explore Mahayana & Vajrayana Buddhism.  Buddhism is about transforming the mind and discovering the path to true happiness. To achieve this, first we need to take focused action to uproot the negative emotions, destructive mental constructs, and negative habits that continually cause suffering for ourselves. We also need to cultivate virtues in our mind such as compassion, loving-kindness, and wisdom. This way we can transform ourselves to a point where we experience stability, peace of mind, and lightness within our own mind. This results in happiness for ourselves and others.  Our group is under the guidance of our precious Lama Namnang Mingjo Dorje Rinpoche, a very humble yet immensely accomplished yogi, whose sincerity, dedication & guidance is very inspiring & brings the Buddhist teachings alive in our daily lives.  The aim of our group is to provide our members with both an in-person as well as online learning environment to explore the incredible wisdom and application of Buddhism. We have on-going weekly teachings & study groups that provide practitioners with an opportunity to not only learn Buddhist philosophy, helping us to better understand the interplay of cause and effect (the law of karma) and help us to contemplate and look at ways to change ourselves. As well as learn Buddhist meditation practices that help us to increase & stabilize key virtues (charity, ethical discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom) within us, and give us a first-hand personal experience of what it is like to experience a mind that is stable, quiet, calm, peaceful, joyful and light.  This is a very rare opportunity to study Buddhism in a beautiful blessed environment together with a group of sincere seekers. All of us are also searching and wishing to discover and nurture the essence of our Buddha potential. Come and join us. Absorb yourself in this incredible wisdom and create more inner-peace, stability, & happiness in your mind, your life, & your world! Seize the moment!

The East Bay NLP Meetup Group,3,"This is a Meet Up for people interested in Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).
NLP is called ""The Study of the Structure of Human Experience."" It is also a self development practice: Once we know something about how we structure our experience, we can find ways to re-structure it in ways that provide us with the experience of life we would prefer.
NLP is a remarkably elegant and deeply respectful set of tools to uncover unconscious beliefs and structures that determine our experience, and--again, at the unconcious level--introduce new beliefs and structures to our hidden selves.
At these meetups, we learn and practice NLP techniques, and learn about and discuss NLP principles and frameworks. We have had a number of meetups so far and they have let people practice NLP skills in a relaxed, fun environment. We've had everyone from experienced practitioners to those just starting out.
For those of you who know something about NLP, we've worked on anchoring, rapport, language patterns, parts work, and much more. So come and explore!"

The Shadow Effect Meet Up,3,"
 
What is the Shadow?

The shadow contains all the parts of ourselves that we try to hide, deny or suppress. It is the keeper of all the aspects of ourselves that we dislike and the qualities that we judge as unacceptable. The shadow wears many faces: angry, critical, fearful, lazy, controlling, selfish, weak, pathetic… These are the faces we don
’t want to show the world and the faces we don
’t want to show ourselves. Most of us expend huge amounts of energy trying to get rid of or control these unwanted aspects of ourselves. We hope that by hiding or fixing our 
""bad qualities
"" we will have the peace, success and happiness we desire. Most of us are convinced that we are flawed and inadequate so we become masters of disguise, and go to great lengths to hide our bad qualities from those around us – even from ourselves.
The result of turning our backs on our dark side? A life that slips by only half lived. Dreams that are never realized, or worse, that lay buried under years of resignation and shame. Until we make peace with our shadow we will continue to be at war with ourselves. And our outer world will mirror our inner struggle. What we resist persists – and we will create and attract from others that which we most dislike in ourselves. Until we feel authentic compassion for each and every aspect of ourselves, we will continue to draw forth people and events that will mirror the negative feelings we have about ourselves. Until we take back our power and forgive ourselves for being human we will attract people who push our buttons and reactivate our emotional wounds. And until we find the courage to love ourselves completely, we will never truly be able to experience the love from those around us. We don
’t need to guess how we really feel about ourselves at the deepest level. All we have to do is look at how the outer world treats us. If we
’re not getting the respect, love and appreciation we desire from the outer world, it
’s more than likely we aren
’t giving these things to ourselves. This is the benevolence of the Universe in action. The whole world is a mirror of our own consciousness, and when we make peace with the disowned aspects of ourselves, we make peace with the world.
 

The Shadow Effect Movie

The Shadow Effect, a visually stunning and cutting-edge documentary, will inspire you to step out of the self that you’ve known and break free from the bonds of the past. Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Dr. David Simon, and other world-renowned thinkers join Debbie Ford to reveal the transformative power of your shadow—the parts of yourself that you dislike and disown, the past that you regret and repress, and the future that is waiting to be birthed. The Shadow Effect will leave you breathing deeper as you take back your power and step into the possibility of the next greatest evolution of yourself.

"Love, Intuition and Spirituality",3,"The purpose of this group is to learn how to live from love, and connect to your intuition and spirituality. There are only 2 basic emotions, fear and love. If you choose to live from love and inner wisdom, this meetup is for you.
Your intuition is how your higher self, your spirit, communicates with you. It is all wise, all knowing and all loving. It knows the past, present and future and is not programmed like the mind is. Everyone is intuitive. It comes with the human package. Only fears block it. Remove your fears and you can live as the master of your life!
Spirituality is living from love rather than fear. It is choosing to be the loving person you really are. Awaken to your true essence of love and your life can be amazing! It has helped me be healthier, happier, more successful, and fulfilled in every area of my life! And you can, too! Go for it!
The fun and profound events are healing and transformational, because the goal is to to help you to enjoy a peaceful, loving and joyful life. 
As a licensed  Marriage and Family Therapist, intuitive counselor, spiritual teacher/healer and author,  I will be honored to support your connection to your wisdom, love and spirituality. 
Looking forward to meeting you.

Lean Culture,3,"Lean startup is a startup methodology which aims to reduce the market risks and minimize capital requirements by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.
But while the lean startup methodology has become practically a gospel in the startup community, it is more honored  in breach than in practice.
Why is it so hard to be lean?
Lean is humble; it requires admitting that you don't know your market as well as you imagine.
Lean is frugal; it entails making do with less or even with virtually nothing.
Lean is disciplined; it requires us to focus on areas that are not our natural forte.
What can entrepreneurs do to foster a lean culture?
1) Learn lean startup methodology.
2) Practice lean startup methodology where you have control.
3) Promote lean startup methodology outside your areas of control.

"I am Happy Project - San Francisco, CA",3,"Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.
According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:
“When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person’s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.”
Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.
If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you. Visit  for more information; while you are there please follow us on twitter and like us on Facebook."
Santa Cruz Meditation Group,3,"Healthy minds dance for joy! Come celebrate and explore the experiences of a lifetime! Meditate, dance, shake, visualize , draw, and talk to keep your mind and body in good health. Find the skills that work for you!  This is the place where you get to try out different experiences from the field of Mind-Body Medicine. Mind-Body Medicine is an up and coming integrative health perspective. It links our overall health to the connection between our mind and body. Most people talk about the benefits of Mind-Body Medicine as learning skills for good health. Its true benefit to you is having experiences which positively affect you. The experience of participating with this group will positively change your understanding. You won't know what you've been missing until you try it. Similar experiences improved my outlook on life a thousand fold! I am healthier than I've ever been, where it really counts! in my head! The impact of this positive change in my life and everyone around me has been astonishing. Care to be astonished?  I wish I could say that meditation is the best way to start. Its how I started, its what I'm best at, and its how I got to be here. After seeing the experiences others have had by participating in Mind-Body exercises I have to say its not! Mind-Body exercises work faster and are more fun! Meditation is the purest mental exercise though and can become a wonderful part of your life as well. This group will engage you on many levels from dancing for joy to the deepest meditative experience.  Yeh!  Outside of being a genius with a passion for this stuff, who am I? Professionally I am a civil engineer with 19 years of experience. I've loved playing sports my whole life. I am very competitive and fair! I am not affiliated with any religion. Malyn, co-organizer, is my girlfriend, she works professionally as a pediatrician. In addition to our personal experience we have both received training through the Center of Mind Body Medicine in Washington DC. As I mentioned earlier, this training provides alternatives to meditation that can achieve similar results, sometimes even faster than meditation!  Background  Meditation is a label for many activities which are universal to humanity. Even the simple act of conversing with another person can be a meditative experience. Physical relaxation can also coincide with a meditative experience. When I talk about meditation it includes these types of introductory experiences and more advanced skills. I started this group because I've benefited enormously from meditating, and it all began unknowingly; I didn't know I was meditating! To be honest, I just wanted to be happy. I've discovered how to be happier, how to allow myself to be at my best without thinking about it. Everyone wants to know the answer, How? The secret is...this gritty stuff called emotions. Emotions are there to help us, not just some emotions, all of them. The more this is understood, the more beautiful life becomes. For many people, there are times emotions do not help, its these that can be transformed. Emotions are difficult to work with by their very nature. The group is intended to provide an environment to help you with these in the best possible way, have some fun, share some stories, relax, and also work through some of those emotions. Not me you might say? How can you afford the time? How can you not? What would you give to be happier every day for the rest of your life? I just wish I had figured this stuff out sooner! The goal is to create habitual positive experiences, as natural as brushing your teeth before you go to bed. The result? Living more beautifully with each passing day.  Although I love to use positive words like happiness and beauty when thinking about this stuff, understand this isn't about focusing on being happy, to the detriment of your emotional range, sadness, anger, grief. Its about changing your perspective and experience of living, so that you experience the best possible emotion for the moment you are in. Its not about ignoring the past or the future but finding a way to understand them in new ways. Its by experiencing transformations of perspective personally that change happens. Again, the secret is not to study, but to experience. In this group, the goal is to have a range of transformational experiences, some will incrementally affect you almost without notice, others will be immediately life altering. There are mind-body exercises which can lead to instantaneous transformational experiences and these will be used to augment the core mediation. The point is to set time aside to develop skills for making life easier, fuller, with more happiness, calm, and resilience.  Yeh! Again!"
"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress",3,"Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?
This group can help.
I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.
The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. 
If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.
Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.
Member-to-member Connections:  In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.
Affiliation:  I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.  I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.
Activities:  We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.  The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. 
Interests:  We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.
Membership requirement:  Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.
Intention:  My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.  My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. "

 "
Bay Area Sound Healing Group,3,"Resonant Harmony Attunements
The Resonant Harmony Attunements are designed for two purposes:
1. To Create Community Where We are All Connected – When you share sound together, everyone's whole system shares the same vibration or frequency -- brainwaves, heart rates, and electromagnetic fields align, and we all become like family. In fact, sharing sound together is a portal to remembering the ultimate state of where we are all One -- particularly when the sound ends and we enter that divine place of peace where we disappear. We believe this is the ultimate goal, Oneness -- for when we exist in a world where we are all one there is no more conflict, no more war -- and only love and light permeate all of our relationships. Coming together in sound creates this Community, where we are all connected, one with all humanity and life --including everything on the planet.
2. To Bring Us into Higher States of Consciousness – A Higher Frequency - There are two general types of states: a. A State of Bliss – Defining “Bliss” as any high state of consciousness – including that of Gratitude, Compassion, Joy, and Love (personal and Universal). This state could be simply Perfect Presence or simply just a sweet state of Well Being. Of course, music often takes us to such a place. It is even more powerful when the underlying sounds are also working towards inducing the same state, and when you include a powerful Intention. b. A State of Deep Peace – Not just silence (because silence can be uncomfortable), but a place of peace like no other. It happens when the sound ends on the root, home note of the song and fades ever so slowly -- seamlessly melding into the silence. When this happens the last frequency heard remains in the room – humming ever so still. The slower the fade, the better.
The Events include many different Experiences. Sometimes a night might be devoted to one particular type of experience; Often we will have multiple experiences in one night:
1. Sound Healing Concerts – Wide variety of groups based around Sound Healing and Raising Consciousnes.
2. Sound Journeys – Experience the healing and consciousness raising aspects of sound as you lay on the floor with your eyes closed. We play a wide range of natural sounds all around you, including using the voice to induce higher states of consciousness. The journeys often include Crystal Bowls and Tibetan Bowls.
3. Toning with Intention – Most of our meditations are done with a conscious stated Intention. It is well-known and has been proven through research that Intention really does work.
4. Chanting – Chanting songs from around the world. No singing experience required. We often do Kirtan (Call and response).
5. Sound Healing Music – Wide range of live and recorded Sounds and Music to bring you into a state of bliss and deep peace.
6. Sound and Movement – Taking sound into form in the body and throughout the chakras.
7. Guided Meditations with Sound – From releasing stuck emotions and energy to resonating higher forms of sound and light consciousness."

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,3," 
The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening.  With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment.   As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to.  
I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the outside.
Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.
HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.
This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.
I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.
On FRIDAY EVENING before every one day  Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)
CREATIVE INTEGRATION is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives.  For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.

Earth Wisdom and The Michael Teachings Channeling Group,3," between meetup groups for more information on The Michael Teachings, an excellent article on ""The History of Channeling"",  inspirational quotes and messages, astrological forecasts, monthly trends and more.  And, last but not least, please check out our  The Michael Teachings are a profoundly practical and directly applicable philosophy of life that sheds light upon the the nature of the self, one's relationships with others and on the workings underlying all life and the cosmos in general. It is a teaching designed for use and application on the physical plane, and is very grounded and geared to give each student a kind of map of the world from and through which they may more fully examine, evaluate and evolve their understanding of their own personal life experiences.  A major part of Michael's teaching is concerned with reincarnation, its implications and ramifications. Part of this teaching is based upon a system of personality traits called ""overleaves"". Michael gave the information to increase our understanding of self and others, thereby improving the quality of life and relationships. Michael also intended the material be used to accelerate spiritual growth.  This group is also based upon indigenous shamanic perspectives and practices from around the world, utilized in conjunction with the Michael Teachings perspective for an even deeper dive into the nature of your own personal reality and what makes YOU tick, from the inside, out. Working with our animal totems and learning about the traditional 9 Directions and the Michael Teachings 12 Support Circle functions are all included in the work I do with others both online and locally.  Who Is Michael?  Michael is a collective consiousness comprised of approximately 1050 individual souls who have all completed their lifetimes on earth and have cycled off of the physical plane all together.  They now teach as a recombined entity group from the causal plane perspective through various channels, bringing forth information to assist humanity along its spiritual path of life on the physical plane.  Michael teaches that all is choice, that belief is not required, to test out and to question these teachings for yourself, and that personal validation of of one's own essence is the means by which humans progress themselves along the path of return to the Tao. Invalidation of essence serves only to retard and to inhibit such progress, according to Michael. The goal of these teachings is to develop an ever greater capacity for agage` and for unconditional love in our lives. They also offer their causal plane insights without expectation and with unconditional love and carry no expectations of their students, period. They simply offer insight as they see it and each person is free to use what they will and to discard the rest if it doesn't resonate or ring true for them personally.  (*Note: This entity group is NOT the Archangel Michael.)
Who Would Enjoy Being Part of This Group?   This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn more about themselves, their relationships with others, the underlying structure of life, the world in which we live and the universe in general.  Bring yourself, your friends and your questions to an upcoming meetup and experience for yourself what this ancient, humorous and insightful causal plane teacher has to offer you along your own personal path of return to the Tao.  I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you better through our regularly scheduled channeled meetup groups each month. Thank you for your interest in this group and I hope you will enjoy both the information and the comaraderie that you will find in our growing community. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about this group or any of the upcoming scheduled events.

Adapt Foundation,3,"The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.
We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.
There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.
The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you.

When the family system is a good order, love flows to us and success comes to us. When the family system is stuck, life can be a struggle. The family system can be tangled from any unresolved trauma from past generations, known or unknown to members of the family. Unresolved trauma could be a sibling that died in childhood, a parent that lost their parent at an early age, a grandfather surviving WWII. The unresolved trauma lives on in the family soul. This can block us from success, health, romantic relationships, career and finances we desire in life. If you are experiencing blocks that you can't associate to anything specific, Or if you are experiencing blocks that stems from an undefined sadness, this group may be for you. Find the deep peace and relief from family constellations."

Our members DO NOT have to wake up at the crack of dawn to enjoy all that Toastmasters offers. 
Most people associate the name Toastmasters with public speaking improvement training, but did you know that public speaking is only HALF of what we offer? 
The Evening Toastmasters offers two parallel self improvement programs:  
Competent Communicator - 10 standard projects which will incrementally improve and fine tune your presentation skills. You may move through your projects at your own comfortable pace. 
Competent Leadership - Ten Leadership projects which will improve and fine tune your listening and management skills. You can become a polished and more effective manager, business leader or entrepreneur at your own pace. 
Evening Toastmasters is a well established club having its beginnings in 1991. Founded by Dan Robin, Steve Hardy (still an active member) and a few others, including Jim Griffin from the SCO Club in Santa Cruz. Our club started at a little library room in Santa Cruz, and has now grown to occupy a very comfortable space in the Live Oak Senior's Center at 1777 Capitola Road, Santa Cruz, CA 95062.  
Plenty of free parking and only a short walk from your car to our front door. 
Enough about us, let's talk about YOU! 
What are YOUR personal improvement goals?

Are you thinking of starting your own company and need to obtain funding? 
Are you working at a non-profit and need to apply for grant money by making a powerful presentation?

Then, when you are ready, you may become a Mentor and help one or more of the next group on their way to reaching their personal goals.

Corporate Leadership Development Meetup,3,"Hello potential leaders,
This is a group for you if you would like to develop your leadership skills. Transitioning from senior management of a company to leadership is not an easy transition. What I found is that to make the transition successfully, executives must navigate a tricky set of changes in their leadership focus and skills. They must learn to move from specialist to generalist, analyst to integrator, tactician to strategist, problem solver to agenda setter, warrior to diplomat.
The agenda for this group would be to help each other through this transition. We would do that by sharing our experiences and learnings in the organizations we work for. This group is idea for those who are in management roles and would like to pursue leadership opportunities (VP, SVP, EVP, C-suite). This group is also for those who are in leadership roles and would like to grow further into those roles. Although age is no bar, it would be best if we target folks in 30s and early 40s age group. We would meet regularly and exchange ideas, information. I would like to get suggestions from group members as to what the agenda/activity for meetups should be. At my end, I transitioned into a leadership role recently. I woul be glad to share my experiences with the group and help those who would like to transition into leadership roles."

Positive psychology has three foundational areas of development: positive emotions, positive traits, and positive community engagement. * Positive emotions lead to a pleasant life experience. Germaine to this are things like development of contentment with your past, happiness in the here and now, and hope for your future. *Developing your positive individual traits will help you to lead a more engaged life and experience flow states (which are awesome!). To experience more of this we will explore our strengths and virtues, such as our capacity to love and be productive, and our potential to develop our full potential to be courageous, compassionate, resilient, creative, curious, in integrity, self-knowledgable, moderate, self-controlled, and wise. *Using our strengths to benefit our community and the world gives life meaning and purpose. We can develop our potential in this area by studying what meaning and purpose mean to us as individuals and how we can strive to use our strengths to improve our communities through our efforts in such areas as as social justice, personal responsibility, kindness & compassion, parenting, nurturance of others, modeling a strong work ethic, developing out leadership abilities, promoting teamwork, building purpose, and sharing tolerance.

Tap into Magic In Your Biz And Life,3,"Tap Into Magic is a group of fantastic Bay Area folks who are interested in learning more about Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT).
EFT often works when nothing else will.  This energy psychology technique has been used successfully on a wide range of emotional as well as physical conditions, including anxiety, addictive cravings, depression, traumatic memories, phobias, pain control, stress, disease and personal performance.
It has the ability to bring quick and permanent relief and can be used on virtually anything with a high success rate.
The Organizer of this group is Expert EFT Practitioner Kate Winch, Kate leads Abundance Tapping Workshops and Teleclasses , she also works with people one on one via Skype , phone or on person.

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,3,"We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.
For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person.  However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'.  And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.
According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.
This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.
T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).
Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....
This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.
We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.
Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.
You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,3,"This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! Visit Eat LIke A Goddess now for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body."

Exploring the Tools of Energy Psychology to Change Your Life,3,"Energy Psychology (EP) consists of a number of holistic modalities that use a mind-body-spirit approach to healing. The premise is that any illness or dis-ease has physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components and that all of them need to be addressed for deep and complete healing to occur. On a basic level, everything is made of energy, including our bodies, so when imbalances or blockages in the energy flow occur they can result in any number of issues or problems, such as stress, anxiety, depression and more. EP tools are designed to identify and remove those blockages so that the body-mind-spirit can heal itself.
This group is for those seeking more information about healing using these innovative tools. Some of them can be used for self-healing, others are for working with a therapist or other health professional. My intention is to provide an overview of what's out there beyond the traditional tools of western psychology, open to anyone who's interested.
I have another Meetup group called the Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology, SF chapter ( which is dedicated toward health professionals who would like to know more about, or who are already using these tools in their practices."

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,3,"Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you. 
Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel dispirited by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.
Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate. Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion)."

This group is for strong women (and men) who find themselves living life in survival mode rather than victory mode. You get smaller to allow someone you love to get larger.

I was none of those things and it happened to me. Words do hurt. Drugs do kill. They killed who I was for 9 years even though I didn't not use them. If you need a safe place to land and get the strength the grow without judgment this group is for you. The goal is support each other through sharing caring and empowerment.

Let Go of Your Past and Make New Positive Friends,3,"All of the meetups for this group will take place at the local Church of Scientology, where I am a volunteer. You can be of any religion to come. For example, I'm a Buddhist myself. You are not expected to change your religion here.
1.  Have you been through stressful past situations, and you want to mentally move on? 
2.  Are you interested in building new and strong relationships?
If you answered YES to both of these questions, you should join this group.
Having been a life improvement consultant at a non-profit organization for over 20 years, I know one of the reasons people cannot be positive is because they are tied down by their traumatic experiences.  It's hard to be healthy mentally when you are reeling from your past upsets.  Therefore, part of our activities in our meetups will be discussing ways to get over traumatic events, and, if you are willing, share some of your experiences with the other members.
Another reason people cannot move on is because they lack the relationship building or communication skills they need.  For example, they may be introverted, uncomfortable talking with strangers, or do not seize opportunities to meaningfully connect with other people.  Therefore, we will be discussing relationship building skills as well.
All of our meetup events will provide time for individual discussions, so members can share their deep thoughts and personal experiences.  Typically, we'll have one meetup per week, and the first hour of the meetup will be a workshop to learn some tools for how to let go of the past and make new friends, and the second hour will be for individual discussions.  All the meetup events for this group are free, and members are encouraged to bring friends. 
If you are interested, join this group now. For any questions, please call Tony the Organizer at (916) 519-5287.
The Church of Scientology is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place. I choose this location deliberately. It is the one place in town where I've observed people really get effective help for their traumatic experiences.  We all need all the help we can get to make our lives better, and this place is a good resource.  "

We regularly do exercises to experience the first steps towards creating our transformed and improved selves. We will be introduced to techniques that can transform ADD into more focus, transform Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder or Anxiety into calm certainty, change a roller-coastering life into more calmness and stability, or workshop on getting our lives out of a rut and progressing.
Real help is possible, as a few of us have experienced. Free support group meetings conducted by professional Mind-Body-Spirit counselors who care. Friends and family are also welcome. ______________________________________________________________

Vulnerability Cafe,3,"Do you wish there were a place to share your deepest truths, the ones that are socially difficult or perhaps buried due to trauma or abuse?  
In these complicated times safe havens are at a premium. 
The struggle is far greater when life's opportunities look more like an out of reach brass ring on a fast spinning merry-go-round. 
My intention is to provide a safe place for us to connect and learn how to speak our truths without fear of injuring ourselves or others. 
If you would like to ride the tide of vulnerability beyond the undertow, and into safe waters, then this group is for you. 
Share your choices and experiences, and how they have impacted you to date. 
What has worked?  What would you like to change, and why?
Join us for an intimate discussion on learning to live and flourish outside our reactive reptilian brains for deeper more meaningful connections and greater sense of purpose and joy for us, and those whose lives we touch.

The Don Draper Club,3,"A social group for professionals with fucked up pasts.

After the Fire,3,"For Santa Rosa / Sonoma County residents who were affected by the recent fires. You don't have to have lost your home or business in the fire to be affected.

If you are experiencing survivor guilt, you're also welcome! Our weekly 2-hour gatherings will include sharing of experiences, healing rituals, resource exploration, facilitation of exercises to deepen and strengthen our self-care, and more as needed by the group."
Overcome Anxiety with Hypnosis,3,"Hypnosis can work wonders for people who suffer from any kind of anxiety. This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. 
Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because  they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. 
Please add yourself to our group. 
If you'd like to personally find out how hypnotizable you are, take our quiz at:

Relationship Tools Meetup Group,3,"""CHANGING ME CHANGES WE!"" This group is for people who want to improve their relationships. If you want to make a bad relationship into a good one, or a good relationship into a great one, this group is for you! It's sad, but true: love is not enough. Successful relationships also take skill. Skills like setting and enforcing boundaries, actively respecting yourself and others, knowing when and how to take care of yourself, being assertive--all play a part. I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist, and I realized I was teaching the same skills to all my clients. I created this class for my clients, their spouses, and others to accelerate their learning of crucial relationship skills at a low cost. Learn winning strategies and un-learn losing strategies in this eye-opening, interactive group. And if you're in therapy or working a 12-step program, this will definitely give your process a boost! We'll have 2-hour meetings in the daytime and/or in the evening--come join us!"
"From Surviving to Thriving, ACA",3,"Let's explore Adult Children of Alcoholics/Dysfunctional Family issues and how they might be impacting your life today. These issues mostly show up in interpersonal relationships with spouses, co-workers, relationship partners, friends, etc. Excerpt from a workbook: ""The term ""Adult Child"" does not mean that you live in the past or that you are infantile in your thinking or actions. It means that you meet the demands of adult life with survival techniques learned as children.""
Let's explore the possibilities of transformation from surviving to thriving."

Peer Support Group for Children of Narcissistic Parents,3,"Growing up in a household ruled by personality disorders can forge memories inside us that last a lifetime. These experiences of our parents can be ludicrous, unbelievable; they can be fantastical and full of strange behavior; they can be brutally inconsiderate, with hideous abuse and neglect. At times, sharing these stories with the outside world can produce stares of disbelief - but when we meet together and witness each other, we feel seen and heard in profound ways.
Did you grow up in a home like this? Seeking togetherness, understanding, a chance to share challenges, triumphs, and those weird memories of home that make life hard but meaningful? Come join us to be supported and heard."

This is an informal group not facilitated by a Licensed mental health professional, just peer run. If this sounds like a meetup you would like to attend, please join. 
Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.

We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.

""Receiving empathy is a wonderful gift, but so is offering it."" - Brene Brown."
Candor: High Control Group Recovery,3,"We were born and raised in high control groups and, since leaving these groups, have struggled to understand the damage a movement revolving around a charismatic leader and/or elite few can do to the other members. 
Our concerns lie with broken family connections, spiritual and physical abuse, financial abuse, insufficient education and the psychological problems stemming from all of these issues. While we understand that the ideologies of each unique group do have significant bearing on peoples' lives, our focus is to address the unhealthy manipulation experienced by members and not debate the ""rightness"" or ""wrongness"" of organizations' belief systems. 
We want to provide a forum to share stories and ideas, empathize, learn, heal and connect to sources of aid. If you are tired of being ashamed of your former involvement (or are trying to leave) a high control group and would like to meet others who share the same experience, you have come to the right place.       
Anyone who was born into or actively joined a movement -- regardless of size, faith, ideology or length of the group's existence -- and has experienced undue influence that altered their lives should consider joining. All ages and backgrounds are welcome. 
Our members are looking to understand both the positive and negative aspects of their experiences and are open to learning from others' stories.    
Please join our group if you would like to share your story and/or simply listen and learn. It's cathartic to connect with others who understand and have overcome or are still struggling with similar situations.  
Come to a monthly meet-up that begins with a presentation focusing on a differing theme with each meeting.  Topics might include what constitutes a harmful group, specific struggles of people raised as children in high-control organizations (aka Second Generation Adults), gurus and Eastern-based organizations, shunning within groups, charismatic Christian groups, finding professional help, connecting with estranged family members and much more. 
The remainder of each meet up will be open to comment and discussion and end with the opportunity for members to better get to know each other.

Partners of Sexual Trauma Survivors,3,"It can be heart wrenching to watch a loved one go through trauma. With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.
This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other."
Musical Inspiration & Testimony For Abuse Survivors,3,"Our group meets monthly to enjoy musical inspiration (listening to gospel selections, a local singer, or drumming with West African Djembe drums), followed by testimony in a safe, respectful environment.  This means we a) listen to music or participate in creating music and then b) share our stories of what happened and how we survived.  
This group is based progressive Christian values (acceptance, love, forgiveness) and is inclusive of all different types of survivors regardless of sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, etc.  As long as you enjoy some gospel music and are interesting sharing your testimony of how you survived, we welcome you! "
SF Adult Survivors of Child Abuse (ASCA) Support Group,3,"Our meetings follow the ASCA (Adult Survivors of Child Abuse) format. To quote the Survivor to Thriver manual: 'The purpose of ASCA meetings is to allow survivors to share their abuse and recovery experiences, to receive support and affirmation for their recovery efforts; to try out new, more adaptive behaviors and, in so doing, to better understand themselves and their recovery process.' This is a peer support group not a therapy group and is for abuse survivors only."
Living Positive with Chronic Disease,3,"Congratulations on finding us. The last thing you needed, on top of chronic illness, is the frustration of finding help. Hopefully this group will help.
I didn't start this group and it's not mine. It's ours. Just like the dreaded pirate Roberts in Princess Bride, it was passed on to me after it was passed on to them. Thanks to those before me. I hope I continue the group as it was intended.
Here are my proposed goals for the group:
1. Equal time for equal pain. No one likes to talk more than I do, but equal time should be had by all. Wait, I'm not finished yet.
2. We laugh, we cry, even if you're a guy. Rhyming is not required.
3. Accommodate the accommodations. Sit, stand, or lay. Light, sound, and smells can all be adjusted to fit your needs. Please: shower-yes, perfume-no. Make-up is optional, clothing is not.
4. Too late, too early, wrong day, right place. We adjust as needed to be accessible to those interested in attending. If you don't have a horse in the race you can't complain about the track.
5. Nothing leaves the room. Well, we do, but what we say doesn't. Well, I guess it does, in our heads. It just should stay there. Unless we forget it, which is also ok.
6. All other guidelines to be determined. And determined we will be. In helping each other."
