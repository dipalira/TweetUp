1,"A club for for men* who believe in the following ideas.
*For men because we want to ensure that this club is about friendship and not romance - nothing wrong with romance, but there are plenty of other clubs for that purpose.
""Friendship is born when two people meet and say ""Oh! You too! I thought I was the only one."" CS Lewis
The real existential question confronting America is being able to differentiate between ""culturally"" American and ""legally"" American, not between African/Hispanic/Asian/LGBT/whatever Americans. What’s the difference? In the book, ""If Your Can Keep It,"" the author says on page 4, ""It is not enough for us merely to exist as a people, doing the minimum of simply obeying our laws and minding our own business. Much more is required of Americans if America is truly to be America.""
What is that ""much more.""
Here's my two cents:
A legal American is someone who by virtue of law, like being born in the US or being naturalized, is an American citizen.
A cultural American believes in and supports the precepts below that are foundational to being culturally American:
a) The Judeo-Christian morals and values upon which the United States were founded*: *This principle does not mean that a cultural American must follow a particular religion. But a cultural American must buy into the Judeo-Christian value set above all other value sets. Why? As Washington stated, ""Let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.” George Washington, Farewell Address, 1796. Our political and cultural values, our God given rights, and our economic system, are all based on the Judeo-Christian value set. Pull out that foundation, and the American house will crumble in the winds of multiculturalism. As Lincoln said, ""A house divided against itself cannot stand,"" a clearly Judeo-Christian biblical reference.
John Adams said, ""The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, that is my religion.""  And those two passages pretty much sum up Judeo-Christian values.  Of note - nothing in those passages about homosexuality - if you love America per the principles of this club, all are welcome.
b) A free market economy, with commerce being regulated according to the constitutional original intent: “Every dollar released from taxation that is spent or invested will help create a new job and a new salary. And these new jobs and new salaries can create other jobs and other salaries and more customers and more growth for an expanding American economy.” John F. Kennedy address to the American people 13 Aug 1962
c) A democratic and republican form of government, according to original constitutional intent and amendments, with the federal government limited to only its defined constitutional powers – all other powers being regulated to the states, per the 10th Amendment: ""If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the general welfare, the Government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions. It is to be remarked that the phrase out of which this doctrine is elaborated, is copied from the old articles of Confederation, where it was always understood as nothing more than a general caption to the specified powers, and it is a fact that it was preferred in the new instrument for that very reason as less liable than any other to misconstruction.” James Madison, Letter to Edmund Pendleton (21 Jan 1792)
d) That the English language is the dominant language in which education, commerce, and politics should be conducted.* *This principle does not mean in any way, shape, or form, that Americans should not learn about other languages and cultures - on the contrary. However, people who desire to become an American must make, assuming they have the mental capacity, an effort to obtain a conversant level, both written and spoken, in English. As George Washington said, “we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges, if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment."" And as Theodore Roosevelt said, “We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding-house; and we have room for but one soul loyalty, and that is loyalty to the American people.” Letter by then former president Theodore Roosevelt (3 January 1919) to Charles Steward Davison. An essential element of being a part of any culture is being able to converse in the language of that culture.
e) A firm adherence to the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, and a dedication to using force, in lawful ways and when necessary as a last resort, to support and defend the Constitution, our families, friends, fellow Americans, and all peace loving people of the world who are in danger from the wolves that try to deprive people of the self-evident truths of Natural Law - that all people are created equal before the law, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
The time has come for all of us to realize that you, and I, no matter our skin color, cultural background, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc., are just an American, nothing more, and nothing less.
The goal of this group is to enrich each other's understanding of the above principles, and to then promulgate them to the rest of American society.

9,"We're a social organization dedicated to helping liberal women find one another in areas of the country where their liberal values are not respected. Our intention is to educate, support, and have fun. We hope grass roots movements will grow from our good times around the table."
10,"The object of this Meetup is to have moderated discussions of specific political issues. The members will decide the issue to be discussed at each meeting. The idea is not to have ""winners"" and ""losers"", but to increase understanding on both sides and maybe even find some common ground. Participants are expected to support their positions with facts and figures and with respect for those with whom they disagree."
12,"Join us if you are interested in grassroots efforts to promote Christian values of equal rights and opportunities for all people, regardless of race, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or financial status. Popular public/political rhetoric has defined Conservative Christianity as discriminating, exploitative, afraid of science, and favoring gun rights. The Bible does not support these views, yet because they are touted as Christian, millions of people have taken them at their word. We need to band together to define Christianity as inclusive and grace driven, and support politicians who have these values."
20,"San Antonio Feminists is a meet-up group that helps bring people together for both action and fun.

We welcome those new and experienced in feminist issues.
San Antonio Feminists is an intersectional feminist group that welcomes people of all ages, gender identities, sexual orientations, race, ethnicity, and religion (or lack there of).

57,"Hey I'm Joe. Are you one of those people who loves watching politics and the news and can't seem to find a group of people that are just that into it? Well this meet up is it. 
My intention for this meet up is to focus on current events in the news and allow for conservative, independent and liberal view points on the issue. 
So here is the setup. We will try to meet twice a month to discuss a topic. A meeting on current events and than another that goes into more detail on a topic. That last one is in the format of a debate or discussion. Most of the topics will cover national and global politics. I will try to make the topic or question as non-partisan as I possible, giving the pros and cons on certain ideas proposed. I want to set up about 5 minutes giving the frame of the issue and than let everyone go into a lively discussion where I hope we can all hear everybody's point of view. There is no right or wrong answer so feel free to share your thoughts openly. 
There will be a meeting that happens once every 2 months that will be more of a social but jeez we are going to talk about politics for sure! Another outlet newly introduced by our friend will be twitter which now you can access to discuss and debate ideas and the impact of current events.  There is a link below and the handle here in is twitter.com/AustinPoliChat. I have just one rule in the group and that is even if you disagree with someone else's viewpoint that you remain respectful. So join up with some political junkies!"

64,"Greetings from the largest and most active Voluntaryist meetup in the world!
This meetup is a space for voluntaryists in the Austin area, or anyone that wants to learn more to connect in person!
So what is Voluntaryism? Voluntaryism is an ethical philosophy based on the simple idea that all human relationships should be voluntary, and that force is neither an acceptable nor consistent way to solve problems.  This applies no matter how shiny your badge, how official your title, or how powdered your wig.
As simple as it seems, this idea is pretty radical.  There are some elaborate and subtle ways that people can use force to manipulate and control others, and it pervades just about every aspect of our lives.  This can be very taxing (pun totally intended).  What's worse, trying to talk about this stuff with others can be volatile, and can leave you intellectually and emotionally drained.
Fortunately, the internet is here to help us find each other!  So come out from behind the keyboard to meet other open minded people, and let's build a community of support, friendship and connection!  Like an oasis to a thirsty, solitary wanderer, this meetup is here to foster an in-person, interpersonal community, and provide a space for openness, curiosity and a voluntary exchange of ideas.
If you are new to all of this, that is great too!  Curiosity and healthy debate are always welcome, as long as you leave any toxic hostility at home.  We are not here to tear each other down, but rather to learn from each other, connect, and grow in our understanding of what it is to be free!
See you at our next meetup!"

The Ten Key Values of the Green Party.   
1. GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY  
Every human being deserves a say in the decisions that affect their lives and not be subject to the will of another. Therefore, we will work to increase public participation at every level of government and to ensure that our public representatives are fully accountable to the people who elect them. We will also work to create new types of political organizations which expand the process of participatory democracy by directly including citizens in the decision-making process.
2. SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  All persons should have the rights and opportunity to benefit equally from the resources afforded us by society and the environment. We must consciously confront in ourselves, our organizations, and society at large, barriers such as racism and class oppression, sexism and homophobia, ageism and disability, which act to deny fair treatment and equal justice under the law.
3. ECOLOGICAL WISDOM  Human societies must operate with the understanding that we are part of nature, not separate from nature. We must maintain an ecological balance and live within the ecological and resource limits of our communities and our planet. We support a sustainable society which utilizes resources in such a way that future generations will benefit and not suffer from the practices of our generation. To this end we must practice agriculture which replenishes the soil; move to an energy efficient economy; and live in ways that respect the integrity of natural systems.
4. NON-VIOLENCE  It is essential that we develop effective alternatives to society's current patterns of violence. We will work to demilitarize, and eliminate weapons of mass destruction, without being naive about the intentions of other governments. We recognize the need for self-defense and the defense of others who are in helpless situations. We promote non-violent methods to oppose practices and policies with which we disagree, and will guide our actions toward lasting personal, community and global peace.
5. DECENTRALIZATION  Centralization of wealth and power contributes to social and economic injustice, environmental destruction, and militarization. Therefore, we support a restructuring of social, political and economic institutions away from a system which is controlled by and mostly benefits the powerful few, to a democratic, less bureaucratic system. Decision-making should, as much as possible, remain at the individual and local level, while assuring that civil rights are protected for all citizens.
6. COMMUNITY-BASED ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE  We recognize it is essential to create a vibrant and sustainable economic system, one that can create jobs and provide a decent standard of living for all people while maintaining a healthy ecological balance. A successful economic system will offer meaningful work with dignity, while paying a ""living wage"" which reflects the real value of a person's work.
Local communities must look to economic development that assures protection of the environment and workers' rights; broad citizen participation in planning; and enhancement of our ""quality of life."" We support independently owned and operated companies which are socially responsible, as well as co-operatives and public enterprises that distribute resources and control to more people through democratic participation.
7. FEMINISM AND GENDER EQUITY  We have inherited a social system based on male domination of politics and economics. We call for the replacement of the cultural ethics of domination and control with more cooperative ways of interacting that respect differences of opinion and gender. Human values such as equity between the sexes, interpersonal responsibility, and honesty must be developed with moral conscience. We should remember that the process that determines our decisions and actions is just as important as achieving the outcome we want.
8. RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY  We believe it is important to value cultural, ethnic, racial, sexual, religious and spiritual diversity, and to promote the development of respectful relationships across these lines.
We believe that the many diverse elements of society should be reflected in our organizations and decision-making bodies, and we support the leadership of people who have been traditionally closed out of leadership roles. We acknowledge and encourage respect for other life forms than our own and the preservation of biodiversity.
9. PERSONAL AND GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY  We encourage individuals to act to improve their personal well-being and, at the same time, to enhance ecological balance and social harmony. We seek to join with people and organizations around the world to foster peace, economic justice, and the health of the planet.
10. FUTURE FOCUS AND SUSTAINABILITY  Our actions and policies should be motivated by long-term goals. We seek to protect valuable natural resources, safely disposing of or ""unmaking"" all waste we create, while developing a sustainable economics that does not depend on continual expansion for survival. We must counterbalance the drive for short-term profits by assuring that economic development, new technologies, and fiscal policies are responsible to future generations who will inherit the results of our actions."
123,"We are the Adams County Libertarian Party. 
We are looking for people who are liberty-minded, to join us as we discuss the Libertarian ideals, politics and Party, and organize to take back our county.
Who are the Libertarians? 
Well, today it seems that we are everyone who is not on the extreme Left or Right. In general, Libertarians are centrists. We tend to be socially Liberal, and fiscally Conservative. 
We are for smaller government. That means the American people taking care of themselves, not expecting the government to do it for them. 
We don't care if you get an abortion, that's none of our business, we just don't want our taxes to pay for it. We believe the Free Market, if removed from government ""help"", will find a solution, that is far more suitable, and less expensive, than anything government could come up with.

We support patriotism over nationalism and human and civil rights over the mythology of a meritocracy.

1. What methods of government would you like to see implemented? 2. What human and civil rights are important to you? 3. What values and principles do you consider important in a civil society? 4. What definitions and terms matter in our civic discourse? How do you define them? 5. How do you consider the above five terms? Do they adequately summarize your intentions with coming to these meetups? Would you modify them in any way?"

152,"This is a re-evolutionary group. We are re-evolving ourselves and our society so that we can meet, at the intersection of politics and spirituality and stand in our power as humans having a spiritual existence in society. We will explore our spirituality as a basis to engage in politics and political discourse from a place of love and acceptance.  From this space, we will empower and support one another to identify and work to bring about change in the political system and our election process.   
Let's eliminate the hatred in our hearts and free ourselves to practice positive denial.  We believe in what we value and we value an educated, empowered, awakened and united electorate.  ""The peace of God which passeth (human) understanding"" and ""this peace is totally incapable of being shaken by human errors of any kind.  It denies the ability of anything which is not of God to affect you in any way.""  Course in Miracles goes onto say, ""This is the proper use of denial.  It is not used to hide anything but to correct error.  It brings all error into the light, and since error and darkness are the same, it corrects it automatically.""
This is the basis from which we will understand what we discern needs to be corrected and work together to bring awakened policies to our local, state and federal governments.  "

This meeting is for Denver Millennials who are passionate about politics. We are a non-partisan action coalition. This, our first meeting, has a sole purpose of seeing who else in Denver also wants politics in the United States to improve!
Does every election feel like the same BS where two people promise a bunch but nothing changes?
Do you want to do work that impacts the community without having to commit to 10 hours or 20 hours per month?
Do you believe, at the bottom of your heart, that perhaps in the generation of Millennials we could see another awesome transformation of govermnent like America saw during the Women's Rights Movement and Civil Rights Movement? America is only getting larger and there are plenty of people passionate about making her better. We, the Denver Millennial Political Action Coalition believe that we can construct better communities in Denver and then scale out to different cities across the United States to help Millennials be a dominant voice in politics.
If we wait until 2047 or 2067 to have the Millennial voice heard, we will have waited too long. For this reason we must start acting now to see what kind of positive impact we can make in politics today (not 2047)!
If you have a friend who is passionate about politics than bring them on down for this short introductory meeting!"

252,"If you are disturbed by the vitriol of the campaign and worried about surviving the next four years, you have stumbled on kindred spirits. If you are worried by the threat of losing things that are precious to you, this is the group to join. We are an open coalition of like-minded people. Some members are seasoned political activists, others have never ventured into the political action territory before. Our backgrounds and interests are diverse, but we are one in knowing that we are entering perilous times where we cannot sit back passively and watch what happens. 
Indivisible Ogden will be sponsoring local actions with a national focus. We will use the Indivisible Guidebook for advice on effective tactics and strategies. 
This is a call to action. Roll up your sleeves and prepare for a strong defensive posture. Many levels of support are needed. Commit the time and energy you can give. You will feel better for doing something, doing anything to preserve the things you value in society and America. United, we are INDIVISIBLE! 
From the authors of the Indivisible Guide:
Donald Trump is the biggest popular vote loser in history to ever call himself President-Elect. In spite of the fact that he has no mandate, he will attempt to use his congressional majority to reshape America in his own racist, authoritarian, and corrupt image. If progressives are going to stop this, we must stand indivisibly opposed to Trump and the members of Congress who would do his bidding. Together, we have the power to resist - and we have the power to win.
We know this because we’ve seen it before. The authors of this guide are former congressional staffers who witnessed the rise of the Tea Party. We saw these activists take on a popular president with a mandate for change and a supermajority in Congress. We saw them organize locally and convince their own members of Congress to reject President Obama’s agenda. Their ideas were wrong, cruel, and tinged with racism - and they won. We believe that protecting our values and neighbors will require mounting a similar resistance to the Trump agenda - but a resistance built on the values of inclusion, tolerance, and fairness. Trump is not popular. He does not have a mandate. He does not have large congressional majorities. If a small minority in the Tea Party can stop President Barack Obama, then we the majority can stop a petty tyrant named Trump. Who is this document by and for?
To this end, the following chapters offer a step-by-step guide for individuals, groups, and organizations looking to replicate the Tea Party’s success in getting Congress to listen to a small, vocal, dedicated group of constituents. The guide is intended to be equally useful for stiffening Democratic spines and weakening pro-Trump Republican resolve.
We believe that the next four years depend on citizens across the country standing indivisible against the Trump agenda. We believe that buying into false promises or accepting partial concessions will only further empower Trump to victimize our fellow citizens. We hope that this guide will provide those who share that belief useful tools to make Congress listen.
We: Are former progressive congressional staffers who saw the Tea Party beat back President Obama’s agenda.
We: See the enthusiasm to fight the Trump agenda and want to share insider info on how best to influence Congress to do that.
You: Want to do your part to beat back the Trump agenda and understand that will require more than calls & petitions.
You: Should use this guide, share it, amend it, make it your own, and get to work.

280,"Welcome to the Valley Freedom Intellectuals!  We've broadened our subject matter to include freedom minded intellectuals and intellectual positions generally, prominently including Austrian economists like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, but branching out a bit from there.  The change is intended to attract and appeal to a wider audience while staying firmly in the camp of ""friends of liberty"".  As an example, we might meet to discuss the thought of Lord Acton (of ""power corrupts"" fame), despite his not focusing primarily on economic thought.
First off, no, you do not have to be an academically-educated economist in order to join this group. Basically we're just a group for those who are sympathetic to the ""liberty position"", whether that means the Austrian perspective in regards to economics or similar opinions on political, social, and cultural issues.  We will frequently focus on a single thinker for a given session to explore their ideas and relate them to the broader liberty position and its intellectual history.  But we are first and foremost a social discussion group, interest in each  other and our own ""take"" on these figures, who simply serve as a catalyst for our discussions.
Our primary aim is to provide a non-formal setting, where like-minded people can come together for a fun social outing.  If you're looking for food, drinks and lively discussion with other liberty-minded folks, you've come to the right place!
If you are new to any or all of these thinkers or their positions, don't worry, still feel free to come. If you're interested in further information regarding Austrian Economics and the like, we can suggest the following sources:

Webster's dictionary defines train as – to teach and form by practice; to educate; to discipline.
 At Straight Shot - S.H.O.T. (Shooters Helping Others Train), our goal is quite simple; to safely train folks how to use different types of firearms while having fun. Safety is of the utmost importance within our group. When shooting with our group there will always be experienced shooters and NRA instructors at the meet-ups. We believe in letting folks try each other’s firearms, as long as the firearm is safe to shoot. If you wish not to share, that is fine. If you have questions, please feel free to ask. REMEMBER, the only dumb question is the one you don’t ask. Everyone is welcome to attend our meetups. Ladies, at C2 Tactical, you shoot for free on Mondays nights. If you rent a firearm from C2 Tactical you must buy their ammunition. Young folks are welcome but they MUST be accompanied by a guardian (21 or older). Ladies, Tuesday nights and Friday nights at Caswells are free. Like C2, you can rent firearms but must buy ammunition from Caswells. Please check our schedule to see when and where we are meeting.
After our range time, comes the most important part of the evening! We head to a local restaurant to eat and discuss the night affairs. You can learn who has the best price on firearms and firearm related products. You get time to socialize with like minded folks. However, LEAVE your politics at home! Our stance is, guns have two enemies RUST and POLITICIANS… enough said.
Last but not lease, we will be planning some desert shoots before it gets too hot. We will also be meeting on Thursday evenings at 4:00 PM to shoot in competition matches at Phoenix Rod and Guns. Please sign up; come by and give us a shot!  Best Regards,

286,"This group is for Conservatives, Christians, Libertarians, and other like-minded individuals who have been censored, demonetized, banned, or suspended on social media sites due to their beliefs and political views. 
 
FREEDOM VINE is a new Social Media Platform based on the First Amendment. Our mission is to give people back free speech in media and social media. 
 
Why? Due to the recent spike in censorship on other social platforms, Conservatives, Christians, Libertarians and other Right Wing individuals have nowhere to go to discuss topics they are passionate about. This is why we knew something needed to be done and started developing Freedom Vine. 
 
FEATURES:
Freedom Vine is censorship-free and has the ability to create posts, share news articles, organize grassroots movements, create groups, message other users, comment, and share content just like other top social platforms. Users will also have access to our Trending News feed to receive breaking news without the liberal bias. 
 
LAUNCH:
Freedom Vine is currently in beta testing and is expected to launch early 2018. We are allowing a select group of people to sign up and use the platform before the launch to help us with testing and are opening that invite out to our Meetup Group Members!
 
GET INVOLVED: 
If you are looking for an alternative to Facebook, where you can discuss your policial views openly with other like-minded patriots, head on over to www.freedomvine.com to sign up! 
Freedom Vine is free and always will be. If you would like to help combat censorship to give people back freedom of speech, join this group to help organize events and meetups for conservatives to get together and spread the word of Freedom Vine.
If you support the Freedom Vine Movement please share with friends and family to help us grow!

295,"The Wine Party (TWP) is a nonprofit organization whose aim is to present all sides of an issue. Why The Wine Party? Okay, it’s a play on the other “Parties” that people are familiar with. There’s the Tea Party for conservatives and the Coffee Party for liberals and they disseminate information to support their partisan views. How is one supposed to get a balanced view of an issue? 
The Wine Party seeks to solve that problem. TWP wants to present all sides of an issue and create dialogue between opposing parties. Since wine seems to create a convivial atmosphere conducive to discussion, I've chose The Wine Party as the name. Whether wine is served at a TWP event is not important as I know many people prefer beer, cocktails or don’t drink any alcohol. The name of TWP is just to show there’s an alternative to the ""beverage"" organizations.
TWP aims to inform the public on all sides of an issue, create a civil dialogue between opposing parties and to find pragmatic solutions to each issue so change can be realized. TWP accomplishes this by hosting “Point Counterpoint Events” (PCE for short). There are three main components to a PCE.  1. It educates attendees on all sides of the issue. Speakers representing each side will be on a panel.  Most people are getting their “news” from a source that presents one side of an issue….news outlets, talk radio, PACs, organizations, etc. While rallies and marches are great to reinforce the belief of the attendees, they do nothing to create a dialogue between people with opposing viewpoints and may actually hinder the process by reinforcing a “We They” mentality. Let’s bring people with opposing views together and talk about the issues in a mature and meaningful way.  The PCE will not be a town hall meeting. As we’ve recently seen, town hall meetings held by members of the legislature have gotten out of control. Attendees at a PCE are not given the opportunity to ask questions or share their opinion during the presentation. They can submit questions via text or notecards to the moderator who will select which questions to ask, if any.
2. Once the sides are presented, the panel will try to find a solution. The attendees will watch while experts on the issue try to come up with a pragmatic solution, a compromise to move forward. We want people to see opposing sides working together for a solution.  3. Attendees will wear color coded name tags to identify their position on the topic, e.g. Pro, Con, Undecided. After the presentation and solution effort, there will be an opportunity for moderated small group discussions so people can discuss what they’ve just heard…and maybe come up with solutions of their own. For those who don’t want to participate in the small groups, they will have a chance to mingle with their fellow attendees. Either way, it’s a good opportunity to interact with all types of people to broaden their horizons.  TWP’s policy will not tolerate derogatory comments, personal insults, interrupting a speaker, yelling or any other immature or unruly behavior by the attendees or the speakers. Anyone violating this policy will be removed immediately.  Each PCE will be videotaped and made available to people across the country via our website. We’ll enlist conservative and liberal media outlets, PACs, organizations, etc. to sponsor our movement and help spread the word as almost all will recognize the benefit of doing so vs. what we have happening currently. I’d like to have PCE conferences happen in cities all across the nation….go on tour if you will. TWP will offer weekend conferences where 5-8 PCEs will be held to include topics from, but not limited to, the following list:  1. Education 2. Immigration 3. Unemployment 4. Healthcare 5. The Economy 6. Race relations 7. Inequality 8. Federal budget / debt  Those are the topics a recent Gallup poll found were most on American’s minds but other national topics could be included like ageism, privatizing prisons, tax reform, the environment, etc. as well as city specific issues.    I’d like to start the movement here in the greater Phoenix area. Instead of a weekend conference, I’d like to do a standalone presentation on one issue with others to follow soon after and then go on the road in 2018.   We would love to have your help. One way is to help plan the PCE. Another is to "

In 2018, the goal of this group and IndependenceArizona.com is to register the Independent Party of Arizona as a legal entity and recognized Party with the State of Arizona.

Citizen involvement is critical. If we don't stand for something, we generally fall for about anything. The two-party system has been ineffective in handling Arizonan's needs. Collaboration is key to solving any problem, let alone many. People - YOU - make the difference. 
Our Platform? 
Making Sense Common...what does that mean? When all the biased, personal and corporate profit-driven agendas fall away, what truly needs to be done emerges… and the truth shall become self-evident. This self-evident agenda is our mission to discover. There is no ego without wego.
We invite political activists who want to support and/or volunteer to help make this goal a reality. We will need coordinators state-wide for each county for the collection of signatures. A simple breakdown of the numbers necessary (by % of registered voters) is on the IndependenceArizona.com website.
We need volunteers to coordinate meetup groups in each county. This is a perfect opportunity for those who've thought about getting involved with political action, but not sure how. This is a grassroots effort that will grow into a substantial contributing organization in the future of Arizonans.

In case you are looking for ASK, Albuquerque Skeptics is now the new evolution of the ASK group, an amalgam of the old group into a new one!
Albuquerque is a thriving community of many different kinds of people, and many various religions. Then there are those of us without any religion who wish to have the same kind of community and social environment enjoyed by the religious. This is where Albuquerque Skeptics come in.
We are a community of secularists, atheists, agnostics, scientists and educators who want an informal group that is held together by the values we hold dear: reason, logic, learning, and fun discussions!
 
We will have casual meetings, discussions, pub nights, park barbecues, as well as speeches and events which members will be encouraged to attend, but never obligated.
 
To keep the meetup.com page up, we will need donations! If we do not receive donations, this site will go away, only to return when necessary funds return.
 
I welcome you to our page, and you are never obligated to contribute any money to us, or wear any badges or recite any oaths. Come as you are, speak your mind, and we will welcome you into the community!
I would also welcome anyone who is questioning religion, and has never had the chance to meet people without religion before... We're nice people! 
 
Come join us at one of our events, myself and my co-organizer Will would be happy to have you along!

We are a relatively new chapter (July 2016) of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, the first such chapter in New Mexico. AU is a Religion-neutral, Non-partisan organization where the only ""qualification"" for joining is the belief that our secular government and religion should not mix.
Our goal, as activists, is to defend the critical “wall of separation” between government and religion. We will educate the public regarding the importance of the Constitutional guarantee of Church/State separation. As a chapter, we are a grassroots presence in NM and serve as the eyes and ears of AU for the defense of religious liberty in the local community. Though we are based in Albuquerque, issues across NM are in our purview.
As a chapter, we are action oriented, focusing on issues that directly affect the New Mexican Citizenry. Our major thrust for now is the New Mexico Legislation with respect to Options in Dying. This is not in lieu of other pressing topics that affect New Mexico. So join us (Chapter #127 in New Mexico) in keeping the United States of America a diverse secular country which embraces an individual's right to worship, or not, but never attempts to breach the all important Separation of Church and State.
Please join us on Facebook @ AUSCS New Mexico, as well. We'd love for you to ""like"" us.

338,"There are times and situations where you might not feel safe talking about your Liberal/Progressive views in public. Whatever the reason might be, here is a group where you don’t have to watch what you say. You can be yourself.
This is a group for political Liberals and Progressives (meaning left of moderate Democrat) aged 55 or over who meet in small groups, share a meal and conversation freely, and know that everyone there has your back. For a few hours you’ll be free to talk about anything you want - even politics - without mincing words.
The organizers of this Meetup ran a similar group in Denver for several years, and learned how to create a safe environment for its members. That experience lead to some special options. For example, you must use your first name when you sign up, but need not use your last name or a picture of yourself if you want to maintain anonymity. In addition, only those in the group can see when and where we’re gathering so nobody can interrupt our good times.
We don't believe in long banquet tables and loud rooms. We'll have separate checks. 
One more thing: If you are interested in joining our fun group, you'll need to read and agree to our group's guidelines, which we call ""Our Party Platform.""
Our Party Platform The Fun 55+ Liberal Conversation and Dining Group is a fun and friendly dining group intended for political Liberals and Progressives 55 years of age and older. The purpose of this Meetup group is to join with others of like mind and age over a meal, have non-threatening conversations, and enjoy one another’s company. If you fit this category and this sounds fun to you, you are welcome to join us.
However, we are protective of the people who join. To ensure that this is a safe place for people to gather and share their common interests, we are establishing some guidelines for inclusion into the group.
* If you don't know if you are a political Progressive/Liberal, or aren’t willing to proclaim that you are, don't join. The “Progressive/Liberal” label in this context specifically does not include Libertarian, Independent, or blue dog Democrat classifications. Also, if you qualify your ideology with phrases like “socially liberal, fiscally conservative,” this is not the group for you.
* You will be blocked if you attempt to promote your own personal agenda, use this forum to promote your business or causes, or use it as a dating site.  
* We have found that a number of people confuse the term Liberal in the political sense with being liberal sexually. This is not a site for polyamory, etc.
* If you're intent on arguing contrary political views, don't join. Here's a clue: If you plan on bringing fact-checked material or promo material, you're in the wrong place.
* Leave your weapons at home. Yes, we know it's a free country, but do it anyway. If that's an issue for you, don't join the group.
* If you speak in racist, xenophobic, homophobic, or any other biased terms, either blatantly or through the use of “dog whistles,” you will be walked to the door and banned from the group.
* Because we vet people before we include them into our group, we do not allow you to bring guests at our Meetup events. The reason is simple: We want everyone to be on an equal footing. Unfortunately, we have found in the past that a member who brings a guest does not ensure that the guest is Liberal/Progressive, nor has agreed to leave weapons at home. The process to join our group is easy. If your partner or friends are interested in an event, please ask them to join our Meetup group. Then once they attend, if they find that we don’t speak to their condition, they can drop without comment.
* We have a no-show policy to be considerate to each other and polite to any restaurant we visit -- three no-shows and you will be removed from the group. Please keep your RSVP up to date so if you have to drop out of an event, others on a wait list have the opportunity to take your place. Be aware that if you RSVP for 2 people (both people are in the group, remember), Meetup’s robot fills any wait list vacancies with the next single person before selecting multiple person attendees. We wish it weren’t this way, but it’s their system.
* We want our time together to have plenty of conversation and an authentic connection. We don’t sit in banquet style or have large groups of people. We may have a meetup with just 6 people, or up to 10, but very rarely will we schedule time together with more than that. When people sit at long tables, the volume increases and we can only hear the person next to us. We try to schedule a number of meetings in varied locations so everyone has a chance to be heard, but if you want a large group with many people, you’ll probably not be happy here.
By requesting to join this group, we understand that you have read and agreed with these guidelines. With this out of the way, we are looking forward to meeting you and sharing laughs and stories in The Fun 55+ Liberal Conversation and Dining Group.

Let's exit our bubbles and echo chambers and engage respectfully with each other! Our first principle will be to assume that those who disagree with us have honorable intentions, and we will grant each other the dignity due to them as human beings.
For this movement we have borrowed an old american term, the ""chautauqua"". This is was a common facet of late 19th and early 20th century social life. The basic concept is that we will host meetings about difficult topics, sometimes with guest speakers beginning the conversation, other times without. Our goal is to create a replicable model that anyone can use to host a chautauqua anywhere."

Meetings will also be centered around magick and how it can be used to help achieve our political agendas."

Our members are seriously, perhaps dangerously, interested in playing and discussing all types of Roleplaying Games, Storygames and Interactive Fiction Games. Some of us are experts, some far from it, but what we share is a devotion to playing tabletop games as they were intended - with full depth and immersion - without turning them into random silliness or parodies of themselves. We take our games very seriously.   Our mission is to explore the reaches of roleplaying game design, and to communicate our findings, our results and our creations to other gamers through online venues. We run both published games and playtests of unpublished systems. Some of our games may be recorded or videotaped for study and transcription. Some of our games may be edited for online publication.  We’re looking for players who come to the table to play, people who want to get deeply immersed in fictional worlds. You don't have to be an actor, you don't have to do voices, but you do have to think on your feet sometimes, and you must portray your character's actions with consistency, emotional insight and logical reasoning. Most of all, you must love gaming. If you're attentive and respectful of other people's experiences, the rest will follow."

375,"Meet up for conservatives who want to take action to promote and preserve conservative values!
It is our goal to bring different conservative groups and individuals together to discuss ways we can take actions to promote conservative principles.
As stated by Ben Franklin at the signing of the Declaration of Independence; ""We must all hang together, or we will most assuredly hang separately."""
378,"We are a group of informed citizens who advocate for accountable and responsible government. We promote ethics, morals, conservatism and American exceptualism.
All Republicans and Conservative thinkers are encouraged to join.
The benefits of becoming a member in this group are only as limited or unlimited as you wish them to be. The opportunity to meet and promote our conservative leaders on all levels is a very rewarding experience. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the next year and a half because we plan to take back the House and Senate as well as elect and keep a Republican president in the White House. 
While our current administration is bent on forcing a socialist/communist agenda down our throats, we have to stand firm against all forces that threaten our liberty and freedom. The very elements that made our country the greatest in the history of man. We need to see past the niceties and colorful platitudes that seem to mesmerize so many people into accepting what's being said only to find out what's enacted is the opposite. 
Everything starts at the grass roots level. We will all work together in the months ahead to accomplish this inevitable goal.

Are there natural cures for diseases that are being hidden from us because they threaten drug companies profits?
 
This Meetup group is about False Flags (false reasons for starting wars), CREDIBLE conspiracies, politics, spy stuff, history, and  military history. In this group, you'll learn about many countries (including the US, Nazi Germany, imperial Japan,  USSR, etc.) starting wars for false reasons--false flags. You'll also learn that many wars were started for the need of oil (WWII, Gulf War, Libya, etc.). The need for oil drives US foreign policy and many other countries foreign policies. Without oil, countries economies would collapse. When you understand oil & oil pipelines, you'll understand the real reasons for political decision. Wars  are also started to protect the petrodollar and for the military-industrial complex.
Did you know there was a plan to bomb American ships, create terrorism in the US, attack marines in Guantanamo and blame it on Cuba? It was called Operation Northwoods.
Are GMOs meant to control the world food supplies? When you control the food supply, you control people. When you control oil, you control nations.
Did you know that US company is building a pipeline through Afghanistan? The TAPI pipeline to Turkmenistan. 9-11 got  America  in regions where there was a lot of oil. Most of the US troops are fighting along the proposed pipeline route. The purpose of this Meetup is to find out what really is going on in the world.   
The real reason the US is upset with Russia & China is because they are moving away from the US dollar as the reserve currency, through BRICs. Was the invasions of Libya, Iraq & Syria about them moving away from the US dollar as the reserve currency (Petrodollar system)? Should we buy gold to protect us? Is there going to be an economic collapse as the US gets more & more debt and more countries leave the Petrodollar?
Why are US ""allies"" funding ISIS? Why do the ""moderate"" Syrian rebels fight with Al-Nursa and ISIS?  Why hasnt isis attacked US allies such as Israel, qatar, UAE, and bahrain? Why does isis always seem to "" steal"" US weapons?

Our objective is to build a peaceful, people-powered revolution from the ground-up, creating the framework for a society that benefits the MANY and not the few.    As the struggles of disadvantaged populations continue to widen through deepening poverty, mass unemployment, incarceration, and crippling student debt, many now realize that CHANGE is urgently needed on multiple fronts.   It has become increasingly apparent that our political system is not run by its citizens, but controlled by a network of economic elites and private interests. The fundamental divide of profit over PEOPLE must change. The well-being and needs of the people must be placed over profit or else the future will continue to diminish for generations to come.     Our mission is to raise awareness of social, economic and political issues through community organizing, direct action, and communal education. We believe knowledge is a torch of freedom. The path towards LIBERATION and meaningful change begins by empowering others so that they may transform their situation.  It will take a collective effort of shared resources and ideas to restructure our world into one that is founded on economic security, universal human rights, environmental sustainability and equal access for ALL.   The limits of injustice and oppression cannot be challenged until we unite and act to reclaim our power. The time is ripe for revolution.  RISE UP!  “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.”

455,"Citizens concerned for the future of their country, under a federal government that's increasingly bloated, corrupt, reckless and invasive, have a constitutional option. We can call a Convention of States to return the country to its original vision of a limited federal government that is of, by and for the people.
Article V of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and we’re all familiar with that process. It’s happened successfully 27 times in our nation’s history, and it’s how we’ve accomplished some important things, like ending slavery and guaranteeing women’s right to vote. But Article V also grants the same power to the states to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution. That power hasn’t been exercised in American history — yet.
Article V reads: 
The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states . . .  
In other words, two-thirds (34) of the states pass an application for a convention to propose amendments, then the states choose their delegates, and whatever amendments are passed at that convention by the states still need to be ratified by the same process as any congressional amendment. Several states have already called for a convention to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and impose term limits on federal officials. 
We are here to help build a local grassroots organization to help promote the Article V movement. Our goal is to seek to urge and empower California legislators to call a convention of states, under Article V of the U.S. Constitution. The delegates at such a convention would have the power to propose amendments to the Constitution to limit the power of the federal government.
We are not alone. See also

478,"This meetup is for Christians who are tired of how the conservative right has twisted our faith to gain power. Christ was ths shining example of love and acceptance.

That we leave the edges of our crops for the foreigner in need and so much more that is being forgotten.
Christ is not what the republican extreme has tried to make him, someone who loves the rich, thinks the poor, sick and elderly should just pick themselves up by the bootstraps, think everyone including our children should have guns. Christ would never stand for an orange rich man who despises the poor, talks of sexually assaulting women, is prejudice and a bigot, and who is clearly not even a christian - now becoming our country's leader and apparently the savior for our christian community! If you have balked at the hypocrisy and the insanity of what is being done in the name of christianity then please join this group. Lets show the world that this is not what our religion is about, that we come together on the values and morals that are built on love. That love is indeed stronger than hate.

DO NOT make new investments in gas power plants - instead direct ratepayer money to the 100% renewable energy future our communities deserve.

CYRF is the result of the merger between the California Young Republicans, Inc. and the Young Republican Federation of California.
The California Young Republican Federation was founded with the following objectives:
To develop an intelligent, aggressive, and effective Republican volunteer organization which will work to make the Republican Party the majority party without sacrificing Republican principles.
To support and participate in the formation of the platforms and policies of the Republican Party.
To bring young people into the Republican Party and provide an opportunity for them to find political expression and recognition.
To train future leaders for service in local, state, and federal government.
To work to elect Republicans to public office and secure the appointment of Republicans to other positions in government.
To instill a sense of loyalty and patriotism in the citizens of the United States of America and the State of California To promote good government at all levels.
Aside from the political activism, San Fernando Valley Young Republicans club is a great place to meet like-minded individuals and just have some fun!"

What do we do? We host a monthly Champagne Brunch, usually on the second Saturday of the month (depending on national or religious holidays that might conflict) from 9:30AM to 11:30 AM, at Boccaccio's Restaurant overlooking lovely Westlake Lake, in Westlake Village, CA. Our brunches are open to all area Democrats, women AND men, and we encourage you to invite your high school-aged daughters and sons, as well! In addition to a delicious champagne brunch, priced at just $25, we provide a fun and informative program each month that not only engages our members and guests, but informs you about local, statewide and national issues you care about. It's a fun and effective way to meet like-minded people, become informed, meet local and statewide public office candidates and dignitaries, AND enjoy a lovely Saturday morning on the lake.
Paying it Forward: Our philanthropical purpose began in 2009 with the Democratic Women's Council Scholarship Committee. Proudly re-named last year to honor one of our wonderful area female Democratic leaders, the ""Fran Pavley Scholarship for Empowering Young Women"" raises funds each year to provide area graduating High School women with cash scholarships to honor their achievements & help them on their college journey. Since its inception in 2009, we have now awarded 18 scholarships to deserving ""progressive"" young women, totaling over $18,500. The girls feel so honored to be recognized and rewarded for their achievements both in school and within our community, many of them return for a visit from college each Spring during our awards ceremony to congratulate the current winners and update us on their college (and after) achievements! These young women are now or soon-to-be college grads, making a difference in many different areas: Education, Medicine, Research, Public Administration, Politics, Business and so on. We are so proud of our award recipients, and would like YOU to be a part of this important endeavor!    
How to Attend our Brunch: Just sign up as a member of this Meet Up group and RSVP! If you would like to, you may reserve your seat and pre-pay online here at the March 2019 Event .
Where does our money go? We are a 100% volunteer organization and a registered Political Action Committee (PAC). As such we fall under the regulations of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), the California Political Reform Division, and others. As a PAC, we are allowed to contribute money to individual candidates and initiatives. However, as a smaller, local group, our primary use for funds collected is used to pay the costs of adhering to the various accounting and regulatory procedures necessary to function as a PAC; to provide the scholarship funds for the ""Fran Pavley Scholarship for Empowering Young Women""; to support the Ventura County Central Committee, whom our charter falls under; to pay for outreach to promote and grow our Council; and with funds available, to contribute to local or statewide candidates.  
Fundraising: As our brunches rarely break even, the majority of the funds we collect to contribute to the above purposes is collected from Membership dues and special fundraising events. Twice a year we put on a great event within the community: a Holiday event usually in November, and our annual Scholarship Awards event in late May. As a growing organization, we are always looking for more ways to raise funds. We welcome your participation in our Event Planning Committee, Membership Committee, Public Relations Committee and of course, the Fran Pavley Scholarship for Empowering Young Women Committee!"

We are eager to grow our Trump Troops by pulling people out of the closet who are fed up with the political establishment and ready to take back our great state.
The masses believed what occurred on 11/8/2016, would never happen. The media is still in shock and denial!

657,"Hello scientists, science enthusiasts, and concerned citizens!! 
Let's come together to inspire and encourage each other to be heard. If you’re not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate. Science is not a liberal conspiracy. This is a group for those who appreciate the benefits of science in their lives and want to discuss the current administration’s treatment of scientists and science-based research. The silencing of scientists at federal institutions is unacceptable. The denial of science-based research in favor of politically-driven profits is unacceptable. The March for Science has amassed “yuuuge” support. Some of our events will be to organize a satellite march in San Diego County, tentatively set for April 22nd on Earth Day. Scientists and science enthusiasts of any age, race, gender, sexual orientation, or political party are welcome. Trump has united people.... against him!! As the organizer, I am open to events at fun locations where we can relax and enjoy good conversation, including breweries and wineries. Local breweries love kids and dogs—I have one of each. If you do as well, consider joining us for events that seem suitable. We can also meet at parks and universities to create signs for the protest; plan outdoor events, walks, hikes; and anything else you may have in mind. There is power in unity. Donald Trump has underestimated our power and resolve. My fiancé and I both have PhDs in science, but we are not snobs. Okay, he is a snob, but a beer snob! Ha! We walked in the Women’s March in San Marcos. He saw a sign that he said described him perfectly: So bad even introverts are here. He will likely join us for any events that involve craft beer. Truly, I’d like for this group to be as inclusive and fun as possible. Science nerds for non-alternative facts unite. Let’s go rogue and talk nerdy to each other!!!"

686,"The goal of The Justice Think Tank Forum is to discuss and implement justice in the world based on the principles of indisputable evidence, logic, reason and fairness. Great solutions never put into practice are worthless.
There is a solution to every problem the world faces be it violence, disease, economics, the environment, racism, injustice, war or any of the other social plagues. I don't have all the solutions but any problem can be solved using crowd wisdom, cooperation, objectivity, justice, logic, science, technology, truth, innovation and reason. 
1. We will NOT promote or discuss political/religious grievances or ideologies. 
*Many or most of the problems in the world today are caused by politics of religion, I propose that religious and political differences are the symptom, NOT the cause. 
*Using science and seeking truth we will find the root cause of these problems and come up with science based solutions.
*This is not about one political ideology against another but rather taking the best ideas, the most logical ideas and promoting/practicing those solutions. 
2. We will discuss issues of universal concern in a rational manner and then come to conclusions based upon the current and available evidence. 
3. We will write down our conclusions and agree upon them in writing.
4. We will be objective, (being defined as not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts).

Who should join the Justice Think Tank Forum?

1. Must be passionate and objective about justice. 
2. Must commit 1 hour per month. 
3. Must share the same values of making decisions using indisputable evidence,  
 logic, reason and fairness. 
4. Must to agree to those values. 
5. Must share your knowledge.

700,"Democracy for America • Orange  County
DFA-OC dates to the early days of the Howard Dean presidential campaign. The initial meetings of Dean For America began in late 2002, as Dean’s message that the “people have the power” and it was time to “take back America” attracted broad grassroots support across the country.
With the end of his presidential campaign, the Orange County group became Democracy for America-Orange County. Since then, we have continued to support Dean’s initial agenda. We have aligned with other local organizations to work for peace, veterans issues, environmental protections, separation of church and state, universal health care, GLBT civil rights, woman’s right to choose, and clean money in politics.
DFA-OC members have become active in progressive political organizations and the Democratic Party, and many have become candidates for office or worked diligently to help elect progressive candidates. 
With the change in power in Washington DC, and the move away from the disastrous policies of the Bush Administration, DFA-OC remains committed to working for the issues it has always promoted, until a true progressive agenda is implemented on behalf of the people’s interests.
Please join us at one of our monthly meetings and find out more about DFA-OC. You will meet bright, engaging people, learn about many ways to contribute to your community and have a good time in the process. Monthly meetings: 1st Wednesday of each month, 7 pm, at Karl Strauss Brewery, 901 South Coast Drive, Costa Mesa CA (Metropointe Center).

727,"Can you identify a major, vexing, obvious, easy to solve problem in your society or community? Do you view its resolution as straightforward and highly beneficial? Are you ever amazed at the roadblocks you face as you defend your position?

Your arguments simple and plain, aren’t they?
Your opponents don’t get it and you often wonder why, don’t you?
Your opponents come up with arguments so poor that you can immediately dismiss them, right?
Also, you would be willing to change your mind if you encountered a compelling reason to do so, wouldn’t you?

Would you now care to go through your difficulties with institutions, especially governmental ones?

They could be much more helpful, couldn’t they?
Some even appear to be defending the wrong side of the issue, peddling invalid arguments from a bully pulpit.
Even elected officials and political candidates friendly to your side will soft-peddle the issue for personal reasons—like fear of the voters—rather than courageously educating the public. They may even urge you to drum up grassroots support before they dare come out of their closet—flattering your ego and assigning you another burden .

Let us assume, for a moment, that these institutions did their job, boldly working to serve the public. Evidently, they promptly would:

notice that this issue produces emotional conflicts and resentment among many people
perceive this situation as a problem
add it to their to-do list
let the public know that they are aware of the conflict
make plans to work on it

As they would get to it, they would tackle the controversy:

They would invite the public to formulate their grievances.
As you would personally respond, they would: 

welcome your comments
thank you for them
prod you with some clarification questions
ask you for the leaders or experts you would trust regarding this matter
promise to contact them should enough people recognize their leadership and expertise like you do


They would compile and summarize the information they would get, from all sides of the wedge issue.
They would contact leaders and experts in all relevant fields.
They would look for some solution that would satisfy most people.
The result, from your perspective, would probably be favorable : they would agree with you or surprise you with some original idea that would convince you to alter your position.
In the worst case, they would persuade your friends but not you, leaving you in the uncomfortable position of being “right and isolated.""
Even in this unfavorable case, considering that there are very few people in your situation, they may do you some favor to compensate for your legitimate discomfort.

Evidently, governments and other institutions do not deal with your most vexing political problem in this fashion. Why would that be?

Could they be ignorant? Have they not noticed the controversy? In view of your activism, it is unlikely.
Could they be incapable of dealing with the problem? Yet, as we just observed, it is not difficult.
Could they be aware of the problem but unwilling to confront it? This is a serious accusation , but in light of the above, it would be an error to summarily discard its possibility.

If they indeed understood the problem but had no will to solve it, would it be possible to prove it?

Could they perhaps knowingly ignore other issues too?
Would they be that corrupt?
Could this be demonstrated?

Would there be one issue that would expose their hypocrisy in a way that would exclude lack of knowledge or resources and that would be straightforward for people to understand? This may be key to resolving your problem.
It so happens that there is such an issue. You now stand in front of its proverbial rabbit hole . Once you have explored it, the problem that brought you here will appear to you as child’s play and you will realize why you naïvely thought that what has caused you so much grief would have been institutional indifference or opposition. It is less a matter of random incompetence or negligence than of intelligent design.
Would you find ten minutes to probe further? Be 9/11 Truth’s guest!

Dan Noël

We can change it later to add men if we choose as a group. ? Some of us have lost long time friends as a result of the current election and our polar opposite views. I'm starting this group to meet other people in my area that are wanting a group of like minded women who want to go have fun together. Dinner/drinks, dancing, bunco parties, beach outings, music concerts, comedy clubs. What do you want to do? Let's get together and have a good time!
Let's talk and plan our first function! It should be cost effective and fun for all."
747,"OK I just took over the group, but the point is to make this fun. Republicans need to be able to meet and speak freely in a BLUE state. So this meetup is a great place for that. We can start with Happy Hours once a month. 
As things progress, we can do weekend events, meet, mingle, bowl, picnic, see movies, BBQ, or host game nights at somebody's home. The point is that we'll have a unified group to socialize with where we're all on the same page. 
I have other groups I manage and they are difficult some days, like walking on egg shells because when someone starts spouting off about how much they hate Trump, people take sides. Then the activity based group becomes politically charged and difficult. So by having a group where we're all pointed in the same direction, there's less stress about politics, which at this point is in the forefront of our thoughts as mature adults. 
So send me messages if you have a Club House with a pool or a nice place to entertain folks on the weekend. It will probably be on Saturday afternoons in all honesty. That's when we all have time to RELAX. 
We'll use the message board for important notifications like jobs, or needed general announcements that need visibility. I do marketing for small businesses, but I hesitate to push that unless someone really needs help increasing their revenues 30%. For the most part, I just want to create a unified social environment. 
I wish this state was RED. I've lived in Denver, New Jersey, New York, Indianapolis, Arizona and this is my home state. I've always been very conservative. Even in college I felt like I had a stick up my ass. But I tried to keep an open mind. As I get older, I find my mind is still open but I'm deeply republican. 
If anyone needs help, I'm the first one to volunteer my expert assistance free of charge. I'm an MBA with experience in manufacturing, service, B2G, B2B, B2C, banking, licensing, e-commerce, and e-marketing. I have a service I can ask legal questions on your behalf too, confidentially. So let me know if you need help. I keep everything confidential. Nobody needs to, or will ever know. A good decision is priceless and I have examples nationwide to share with you in several verticals. 
So let's stick together and help stay unified. I'm on facebook in several of the Trump Groups.

755,"Hello and welcome!  
Thank you for your interest in this Meetup. It is open to anyone interested in learning, reading, and having conversations about feminism and gender equality. The goal is to read feminist authors and their classic texts and have interesting and thoughtful conversations with others about them! 
We meet on the second Thursday of every month from 6:30p-8:00p at the 5 Dollar and Under Bookstore (2880-A Cochran Street, Simi Valley, CA 93063). For those of us who want to carry on longer, we then head over to Starbucks across the street (2991 Cochran Street, Simi Valley, CA 93063).
Our format: We alternate between classic and modern feminist books each month and have rotating leaders guide each discussion. The leader chooses how to lead the discussion, usually with some suggested further reading, discussion questions, etc. (which will often be posted in the meetup description beforehand). We choose the books as a group at the end of our meetups and aim to do so a couple months in advance to give everyone a chance to plan their reading. 
I hope we may learn from the books as well as each other while building a community of like-minded folks. If you want to attend a meetup and haven't yet read or finished the book, please feel free to show up anyway and participate in the conversation!
I am thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to experience these important and exciting books with all of you!

764,"This group is being put together for the purpose of making Bakersfield a better and safer place to live. If you are interested in taking a PRO-ACTIVE ROLE in building an alternate revenue source to replace local taxes, creating new jobs by starting new businesses, or lowering the crime rate than this is the group for you. 
  Introduction: 
  My name is Nathan Nemnich, I am a 63-year-old USMC Vietnam era vet. I was one of the twenty-five individuals that ran for the Mayors seat last year, I was the only person running with a plan to make Bakersfield a better place to live by building from the ground up a local organization dedicated to making the money needed to replace taxes, start new businesses to create new jobs, lower the crime rate, and I came in last.
I have presented the plan to our new Mayor and City Council, pointing out that by creating an alternative source of revenue they could, in time, eliminate the need to rely on local taxes to run the city. Neither the Mayor nor anyone on the City Council were interested in lowering taxes. What makes it worse is the fact that I went to our local media and they were not interested either. Our local media said that someone with a plan that could, in time, eliminate local taxes was NOT NEWS WORTHY.    
Now I am asking the people of Bakersfield for help, starting with this meet up group.
I fully admit that I am not a businessman, I desperately need individuals with business skills, computer skills, and fund raising skills just to get started.
I need people with the ability to do what our local politicians can’t do, “THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX”, and wish to turn a cause into a career. At the present time, I only have access to a computer on weekends, so in the beginning please be patient with me. Anyone with organizational skills like, computer techs (white hats preferred) for site development and social media, business and office persons, attorneys (business, tax, and patent), and CPA’s are needed just to get this ball rolling. The group has no funds so volunteers with skills willing to take charge are needed.
The key phrase in this group is, PRO-ACTIVE ROLE, so if you want to help change the future of Bakersfield join up and let me know what kind of skills you have and how you can help. 
JOIN ME AND HELP CHANGE THE FUTURE OF BAKERSFIELD.

770,"Hello All,
I've lived in the Antelope Valley for nearly 20 years and I love it. However, there are events occurring in Washington D.C. that can affect us all, and it has me deeply concerned. Which is one of the reasons why I have decided to run for U.S. Representative of the 23rd District of California.
I don't claim to have all the answers, but what I do know, is that we deserve better representation. With that in mind I would like to earn your support.
As a first time candidate for political office I would like to talk to as many concerned residents in the 23rd District as possible. The area covers West Lancaster, Quartz Hill, Gorman, Bakersfield, and Tulare. Please join me face-to-face among other progressive minded residents and let's talk about the issues that concern you and your family the most. As neighbors we are all in this together. We must make it work.

792,"We Are Change is a citizens based grassroots peace and equal justice movement working to reveal the truth behind the events of September 11th, as well as the lies of the government and corporate elite who remain suspect in this crime. In addition, we are here to aid the sick and dying first responders through fundraising and social outreach programs in order to promote awareness of those who suffer from physical, emotional, and psychological traumas they received in the aftermath of 9-11. We also seek to meet other local citizens who are interested in educating the public while engaging in peaceful demonstration about the pertinent issues that are affecting our lives each and every day. Furthermore, We Are Change is a nonpartisan independent media organization comprised of patriot journalists working to hold those engaging in activities that do not represent the wishes of “We the People” - by asking the hard questions that the controlled mainstream media refuses to do.
 
We Are Change has arisen from the remnants of our republic to fill the vacancy left by those who swore to preserve, protect and defend The Constitution against all enemies – foreign and domestic. We seek to expose the fraud of the left/right paradigm and reveal that the world truly functions on a top/down hierarchy that threatens to destroy free society as we know it. We Are Change works to educate, motivate, and activate those striving to uncover the truth behind the private banking cartel of the military industrial complex that is directing the majority of U.S. policy, and that is actively seeking to eliminate national sovereignty and replace it with a ""one world order."" We will also continue to move in a direction that reconnects “We the People” to our nations founding principles laid out in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
 
We Are Change also seek an uncompromising and independent investigation into the crimes of 9-11, with subpoena power granted to obtain a long-overdue resolution for the survivors and families of the deceased. We reject the official explanation of the events leading up to, during and after the attacks of September 11th, 2001 as well as the fear-based politics and state mandated propaganda being disseminated by the Corporate Media which has facilitated the cover-up of 9-11.
 
As we establish citizens groups throughout the country and world, we wish to inspire a community of truth-seekers and peacemakers through creative campaigns with a commitment of nonviolence. We Are Change is not so much a group but an idea, an idea that “We the People"" are the vehicles of these ""ideas"" and of the freedoms, liberties, and truths we are seeking all across the globe. An idea that captures the spirits of our forefathers who just desired freedom; that together, as residents of this planet, we grow like a snowball of truth and justice rolling down a mountain of tyranny growing bigger and stronger, recognizing the beauty in our differences and the diverseness of each other, but at the same time strengthening our cause because we learn and grow from each others individuality. Then as we learn to come together, that as one, you, me, him, her, us…will realize that WE ARE CHANGE.

We're a community of residents in San Francisco District 6 (which includes SOMA, South Beach, Mission Bay, Tenderloin, and Treasure Island) who are involved in our neighborhood. 5 of us started the group several months ago (see all our posts at  and we decided to put our group on Meetup as well.
District 6 is represented by one of the city supervisors and has generally had low voting turnout and civic engagement. Therefore, a smaller group of longtime residents has generally influenced policies, while the influx of newer residents are generally younger millennials are busy with work and less engaged. 
We’re here to change that! It’s time for the younger and newer residents of SOMA to advocate for ourselves and to ensure that our collective voice is heard. The causes we champion are:
- more housing of ALL types (we're part of SF YIMBY Action -- ) - pro-offices and effective transit - tackling theft and crime - having a clean neighborhood

992,"Our troubled age, and our mission -
In 21st century America, our most vital institutions - healthcare, education, government, the military, the media, the courts, and so forth -  have been overtaken by a small group of financial elites, who have so entrenched and solidified their power through the accumulation of wealth, via the mechanisms of capitalism, that change has become all but impossible to enact within our current captive federal and local governments. In prolonged, unwinnable wars benefiting only defense contractors, environmental policy allowing for the oil industry's continued rape of the earth and contribution to ever-worsening climate change, crumbling infrastructure, and profit motivated deregulation resulting in, for one, the exposure of children to lead in their drinking water, the consequences of this seizure of power have infected, and are continuing to poison, day by day, the health of our citizenry.
While such corruption plays out, negatively effecting all in our nation but the few who are responsible for it, we as Americans remain divided over issues such as political affiliation and race. We forget in the midst of our fighting that our two political tribes, Democrat and Republican, are equally inept to meet our needs as individuals as long as they remain in the pockets of the wealthy, and special interests. And while the racism we see today cannot be said to be the result of class alone, having its roots as well in historical oppression, it has been inflamed severely by the marginalization and humiliation of impoverished peoples of all colors due to the widening wealth gap.
The purpose of this group is thus to unite all - black, white, brown, people of every color, background, and creed - under the goal of reforming our nation so as to allow each and every individual equal opportunity to flourish, and to live free from poverty and the worry of poverty, on a clean, healthy planet. In so doing we seek to finally live up to the proclamation of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and to thus make our nation into what it should have been from the start.
Our means of systematic change will be massive nonviolent, non-cooperation with our current government, such that not a drop of blood will need to be shed for the purposes of taking back our power. All that will be needed will be a collective decision from the mass of citizenry, including law enforcement and military, that enough is enough, and we will not be challenged by the minority who are left to oppose us. It will then be left for us as citizenry to convene a new Continental Congress, as our founders once did, where we will debate and discuss, as they once did, the new, better nation that we wish to build out of the ashes of the old.

The Constitution is a timeless document that guarantees our basic freedoms. We support personal freedom so all Americans can live life the way they want as long as it does not harm others, or infringe on another’s rights.
We are most free when the Constitution is followed and each branch of government serves as a check and balance to the others. We are a nation of written laws. One law for all and equal application of the law is a founding principle that distinguishes America from the lands immigrants fled to escape oppression. No American President, Republican or Democrat, should ever go around the Constitution, no matter how important the issue. No government entity is above the law, and no public official may act outside or above the law. Yet, we have seen that Washington has a reckless disregard for the rule of law and balance of powers.
The government has become too big and too powerful and many of those in Washington have grown out of touch with the citizens they represent. We recognize the government is slowly taking away basic freedoms we each deserve. For instance, every American deserves the freedom to make a phone call and send an email without the government monitoring what we say and write. Every American should have the right to choose our own doctor and which insurance plan we want to purchase without the government penalizing us for not purchasing something we do not want or need. Washington continues to pass laws taking even more freedoms away. Americans sense a freedom gap, between how we value freedom and how free we actually feel today, with an elevated sense that the American Dream is becoming harder to reach.
We support policies that protect and defend personal freedom and individual rights, and the ability to pursue the American Dream without government intrusion. We also support policies that will reclaim those freedoms and rights that have been eroded through intrusive policies of unaccountable politicians and Washington bureaucrats, many of whom answer to special interests and lobbyists rather than their electorate.We believe that our freedom is America’s greatest strength, and that any policy or action that restricts or erodes that strength is detrimental to the potential and growth of our country."

1043,"There are at least a couple of ideas in mind to start with for this group. One is intended to be a place where like minded Trump supporters can get together and perhaps meet some new friends since it seems hard to find sensible people with regard to the president in this sea of Democrats and Trump haters. Another hope for this group is to take action as a contribution to a project that could actually help the president and our country. What project you might ask? The project that this groups initiator is suggesting is to collaborate in a business venture with the marketing of a website called DTrumpReport.com. Contributors would have shares in the company and help to make it a viable platform for spreading the good news about the Trump Administration.
This site is a news/archive of every accomplishment of the Trump Administration since it's beginning. Each story comes with a pertinent video(s) and are categorized by Domestic and Foreign Issues...over 50 categories.
The hope of the site is to show the real actions of the president and to document the monumental achievements taking place under this presidency and to counter the masses of ignorant Trump Haters, maybe even educate some of them.
However, while DTrumpReport.com is currently the best source anywhere on the internet to find the real hard data on the president, next to whitehouse.gov, the site has practically no viewership at all. While I maintain the content of the site, it needs people to market it. It seeks new share holding members who can help make this happen. It means people who are willing to be compensated on speculation that the site can become profitable and money can be made.
So, whether is meeting new Trump loving friends, or getting involved in helping our president by helping to make DTrumpReport.com successful, please do join. When enough new members have joined, our first meeting can be scheduled."
1045,"This is a group for those in the Sacramento area who like to discuss politics and philosophy. We have all had different experiences in life, but we always find that political issues are very relevant to our lives and we want to discuss these issues with others. These days, political discussions are sometimes constructive, but unfortunately they often become hostile when people with differing views are in the same room. It is important for us all to hear views other than our own from time to time, and there has to be a way to have honest, thoughtful discussions on issues important to our lives while keeping the discussion calm and polite. In this discussion group, we try to avoid being overly biased when presenting opinions and we will also work to avoid use of fallacies in making points. We expect that there will be differences of opinion, but as long as we keep a philosophical mindset these discussions should not descend into hostility. Many of us also like to discuss philosophical topics and we will have time for this as well and we will probably find that most philosophical concepts have real-world applications, including political. So this discussion group will hover between these two subjects, and we might even at times focus on other subjects as well."
1046,"We are Happy Conservatives who want to create a better world, and we don't want to just talk about it...we want to take action to make it better. Because working together is more fun that working apart, this working group was formed! 
Most folks within the group are working on individual projects that they are interested in and feel passionate about.  We get together to encourage each other and hold each other accountable so the work actually gets done.
What types of projects are we talking about? Here are some examples:
• Convention of States, State of Jefferson, Illegal Immigration, Confronting Media Bias, Fighting Over-regulation, Election Integrity Project, and so on.
What kinds of things might we do? 
• Letter writing, Social Media campaigns, Coordinate school visits, Coordinate visits to legislators, ... and so on.
If you are looking for a place to talk about problems but not do anything about them, this may not be the spot for you.
If you are the type of person who can take action and enjoy others who take action too, then this group may be a good fit!"
1051,"The state of public dialog is broken, trust is low, and our democracy is degrading. We are forming a meetup to use education, processes, and current tools to raise the level of civic participation in support of the individual citizen and consumer.
Our small team has been developing concepts and building programs, but we can’t do this alone: the public square should be a community endeavor. We're at the point where need your voice in the conversation and to find out where we can contribute along side other programs.
What we propose is that a few of us come together weekly to establish common cause, develop, test, and deploy programs to educate, empower, and engage citizens. We envision localized programs such as: · Workshop and trainings · Public Lecture Series · Local Meetups · Private Groups (topical learning and action communities, campaign support, and mastermind groups) · School and Community programs · Mentoring programs · Organizational effectiveness programs
There are many initiates and programs taking root throughout the country. Let see how we can tap into these and find a way to make the progressive ecosystem stronger for all. I’d love to have you participate, or recommend someone who would be interested in participating in the project."

This is a group for anyone seeking to share their experiences concerning UFO's and looking for likeminded folks of the perspective that of course we're not alone in the universe. I hope to have monthly meetings at a restaurant in the Nevada City/Grass Valley area where we can share our experiences and insights. I envision this as starting out as a somewhat structured support group. As a trained facilitator, my goal is to create a group from which each of us will leave feeling uplifted.

Indivisible uses grass root tactics similar to those used by the ""Tea Party"" in the past to successfully influence Republicans to block President Obama's programs. We have no sympathy with the ultraconservative, mean spirited politics of the Tea Party, but acknowledge that their grass root tactics were brilliant. Their actual numbers were small, but they had a profound impact on Members of Congress. We can use those same tactics to promote a progressive agenda and ""Make America sane again""."

1072,"The Slow Food Movement The founding father of the Slow Food Movement, Carlo Petrini, recognized in 1986 that the industrialization of food was standardizing taste and leading to the annihilation of thousands of food varieties and flavors. Concerned that the world was quickly reaching a point of no return, he wanted to reach out to consumers and demonstrate to them that they have choices over fast food and supermarket homogenization. He rallied his friends and began to speak out at every available opportunity and soon the movement was born and Slow Food was created. Today the organization is active in 45 countries and has a worldwide membership of over 85,000. People have responded to the growing movement, because they have become tired of buying the same things, eating the same foods and living the same lives. With these interests in mind, our mission is to create a robust, active movement that protects taste, culture and the environment as universal social values. Slow Food programs are dedicated to the mingling of taste, culture and the environment. The Slow Food O’ahu Chapter Slow Food O’ahu is one of more than 200 chapters of Slow Food USA located throughout the United States. We are dedicated to promoting the values of the slow food movement on O’ahu. Slow Food O’ahu has a volunteer board and is operates through its bylaws.

1084,"This group is for able, competent, self-reliant, intellectually honest Americans who are ready to do something to put an end to America's 100 year rule by a sick, inbred, polarized, and polarizing, DEM/GOP - Only Political Monopoly.
A Political Monopoly run by an increasingly inbred Political Class corrupted by too much power in two few hands for too long.
Today's sick old political monopoly  didn't always exist.  And only a fool would claim is ""Supposed"" to rule American until the Sun burns out in 5,000,000,000 more years. So it needs to go.  For there is a Season to all things, and its Season is over.
Therefore, if you want to accomplish something worth doing, and are not just looking to hang out talking at each other about interesting stuff, with everyone competing to come up with the worse example of how bad ""They"" are, please consider joining us.
Our goal is simple.  We have a President who didn't grow up a part of today's Political Class as most cheap politicians today have done ... from Obama to Romney, The Billary Clintons to Bushes Three ... with rich politically connected families that made it possible to skip ever having to work for a living, and just going into politics to make their easy millions
So we intend to send President Trump the help he needs in Congress by replacing one of Hawaii's interchangeable Democrats in Congress with someone who believes in America instead of ""Hawaiian Style"" Socialism. 
Its too late this year, but not for 2020 and 2022.
Given that old Lingle Leftovers and HIRA have been playing with themselves  in a mud fight that's driven  HI's GOP into the Grand Canyon of all ditches, it shouldn't be that hard to replace them
And until we do no one smart enough to trust in office will be dumb enough to stand for election wrapped in the ugly banner and carrying the ugly baggage for the losers who have turned HI's GOP into a cheap vaudevillian stage show.
I mean America's founders didn't screw around trying to ""Reform"" a sick old Monarchy.  So only a fool would grow old and try trying to ""Reform"" the clowns who've taken over HI's GOP by disgusting everyone else out of it.
The only option is to do as the founders did. Just start over with a slate wiped clean and build something  better.  Worked well then. It would work well now. Heck ... HI's GOP has already wiped itself off the slate for us anyway. 
Just Remember
... While states like CA and NY have gutted the Electoral College with their made up ALL-OR-NONE rule for Electors, to make us irrelevant in Presidential Elections,
... Hawaii is as powerful as either one in the Senate. And in a permanently polarized House ...  all it takes is 1% to pick who wins.  I mean, with America's majority deadlocked into irrelevance, it's only natural for politicians to ignore us and pander to the 1% fringe minorities. Isn't it?
And good grief if we can't defeat fools like Schotz, we should stop wasting time telling each other stuff we already know about how disgusting today's Political Class has gotten.  And take what we deserve.
As for our neighbors ... they aren't dumb Dem lever pullers kike today's GOP losers claim as their excuse for being losers.
The truth is no one worth voting for is any longer willing to stand for election wrapped in the GOP's soiled banner carry their ugly baggage.
So don't overlook that 50% of voters can no longer stomach voting for the politicians of either party. so you can't call people who won't pull any lever ... lever pullers.
The reason DEMs keep winning with so few votes is HI's GOP can no longer recruit anyone who isn't a sick embarrassment for us to vote for ... I mean after Dejou ... Dejou ... Dejou ... heaven only knows what they'll scrape up next.   
.... My bet is at the very last minute they dig up a reinvented Lingle ... any takers?
And yes ... I did say Hawaii is totally irrelevant in Presidential Elections, because it is.  And that makes it a waste of time to bother with them.  It really is this simple:
-- No one who ever won with HI's 4 Electoral Votes would have lost if they didn't have them.-- No one who ever lost without HI's 4 Electors would have won if they had them.Ok.  Time to put up, or shut up and stop whining I think.
Time to show up, register a replacement party, recruit someone we trust to help Trump, the do what's needed to get her or him elected. Or lay back and enjoy the inevtiable.
If you are willing to help, we'd love your help.

Who should join?  Patriotic Americans who support Donald Trump's Presidency.  Our ideal member is anyone from the greater Portland metro area who is conservative, generally allied with the Republican party, and who is interested in enjoying the company of like-minded people. Why should you join?  This is an opportunity to socialize with people who share a set of values and maybe opinions, and who are also riveted by the amazing dynamics of this last Presidential election cycle.  Who needs Tom Clancy when reality is so much more interesting? What can you expect by joining?  You can expect a pleasant conversation without having to apologize for your frankly reasonable stance on politics. We will create a community of people who will participate in events, such as a TV night when Trump gives a speech, or the NRA has a membership drive if you're into that kind of a thing, or when the Boy Scouts have a fundraiser.

1091,"Welcome to the West Linn Second Amendment Meetup! This is a group for those of us in the Pacific Northwest who believe in the Second Amendment as it was originally intended. Whether you are a gun owner or not, if you believe in individual liberty and the right of the people to keep and bear arms, let's meet!
I was unable to find any other Second Amendment groups in the Portland metro area so let's get one started. I plan on meeting in the West Linn, Lake Oswego and Oregon City area. If someone else would be willing to host meetups elsewhere in the Portland area, I would be open to that.
Perhaps, like me, you may feel that you are on an island and are unable to have a real discussion on Second Amendment issues. I have found that most do not care as much about our right to bear arms as I do, if they even care at all. That is why I believe it is important to have a social outlet for people that feel as we do.
The focus of this group will simply be an opportunity to socialize with others who believe in an individual right to bear arms. We can meet for drinks, for coffee, go on a hike, etc. I would especially like to meet when gun-related legislation is proposed or when a court decision impacts the exercise of our rights. It is important that we stay educated about what is going on. While the focus of this group is as a social gathering, if someone would like to host a meetup to put some rounds downrange, let me know.
I look forward to meeting you."

1104,"Eyes Wide Open is a group of individuals who come from all walks of life seeking answers fearlessly looking at alternative perspectives including unpopular ones.   We tend to challenge consensus reality, political correctness and all forms of information including news, fake news, history, science and religion to see what might be propaganda.  Together we share perspectives through a kind of ""think tank"" creative communion (not debate or argument) that allows the bigger picture to come into focus.  We are also a support group for people who know too much and who would like to be around other like minded people.  The evening starts by setting an agenda that include topics that any member can suggest.  We freestyle the discussion in a very informal and comfortable way that makes each meeting different and addicting.   
As for me, I am not a leader, nor a scholar, nor a savior.  I expect no one to become a fall lower.  I am a facilitator.  I hold a space for people to investigate alternative perspectives and make friends.  
We typically meet in the basement of Flying Pie Pizza in Portland every other Thursday with the notice being sent out the Sunday just prior to the meeting.  We can have anywhere between 15 and 30 people join us.  Don't pay attention to the RSVP numbers...we are non-conformists!  We occasionally have speakers, presentations and allow members to lead the group through different topics if they choose.  We are not an organization, but are not opposed to networking after the meetings.     
The meeting wraps up around 8:30 p.m. and then we walk to Thatcher's for after hours discussion.
I hope you can join us in an exciting adventure that offers limitless possibilities as we investigate the grand illusion. 
Hope to see you soon!!

1111,"Welcome to the Portland Marxist Reading Meetup! To my mind, this group can be defined by contemplating these key questions: Have you ever wondered why we have an unplanned economic system based on profit instead of a planned economic system based on human need? Have you ever wondered why we are a society based on mindless, excessive, wasteful consumption instead of a society based on sustainability? Have you ever wondered why we have impending or materializing environmental and societal catastrophes (e.g., climate change, multi-eco system breakdowns, mass extinctions, poisoned oceans, fish depletions, water shortages, etc.)? Have you ever wondered why we have an overcentralized economy where the wealth of this world is distributed disproportionately to the top 1%? Have you ever wondered why we even have a hierarchal class structure? More to the point, have you ever wondered why we have SO much exploitation, homelessness, human rights abuses, poverty, food deprivation, and all around general mass suffering?  I contend that you can find the answers to these questions and many such more in this reading group. 
Reading and polemicizing orthodox Marxism is NOT my vision for this group – though I do hope we incorporate Marx and other orthodox Marxist material along the way (!) – but, rather, my vision for this group is to broaden out our scope to include a broad range of subject matter within the general arena of a Marxist (anti-capitalist) sensibility, which includes material that covers manifold anti-capitalism platforms, alternatives to capitalism (socialist, anarchist, syndicalist, humanist, etc.). So, why do I call it a “Marxist” Reading Group? I believe that Karl Marx was one of the founding fathers if not THE founding father of an alternative way of (economic) being, ALL alternatives (e.g., socialist, anarchist, syndicalist, etc.) to capitalism stemming from his extraordinary work. In this context, then, I decided to call this group the ""Marxist” Reading Group not only because I think he came up with the core ingredients for an alternative to capitalism but because his incredible body of work influenced all other visionary anti-capitalism thinkers who came after. (And the other smaller but no less important agenda on my part is to recuperate his name and his vision take it back so to speak from capitalist interests who have demonized his name over the last century or so!). 
Ideally, we include both academic and mainstream works for our readings and perhaps occasionally other texts, e.g., films, art work, literature, etc. During our meetups we will discuss our readings, which will hopefully not only stimulate thought and create more enlightened thinkers but perhaps even foster praxis!"

""THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated"". -Thomas Paine, The Crisis, December 23, 1776.
Welcome to our Thomas Paine MeetUp group for the Salem Oregon area. We are concerned citizens worried about the future of humanity and that of the future of the United States of America as a nation and our place in it.

Together, though, we can not only survive the hardships they create for us but overcome and end them. Together we have the strength to help others to overcome them, as well. The greatest weapon the working class possesses is solidarity. We have the freedom to take the risks that saving ourselves will require when we know that our neighbors have our backs. 
We are a non-partisan, but by the very nature of our mission left-leaning, collective organizing for mutual aid and defense. We recognize that resistance to the actions of oppressive institutions and individuals requires helping those who are most harmed by them. We understand that it requires a diverse array of tactics, from something as seemingly inconsequential as holding a ""rent party"" for someone struggling to remain in their home to acts as confrontational as occupying a building or public space. We realize that good follows good and that helping to relieve the suffering of others allows them the freedom to assist us when we might need help.

1118,"Splitting the coast off of Lane County requires half the registered coastal voters to sign a petition, on the  next ballot a simple majority of the coastal votes cast in favor, and then to enjoy independence from Eugene ruled Lane County.  Only the coastal voters may sign and vote; Eugene has no vote in it.  Instead of scraps from Eugene; all the taxes, grants, and revenues by the coastal area paid to support Lane County will then REMAIN in the service of the coastal people.  Only then will the coast have County based services with true local representation for our current state of taxation.
Your New County will Focus on Essentials:
Safe - Your new coastal county will have its own “resident” Sheriff, patrol deputies, Judge, DA, courts, health & human services, and other essential programs.
Local - Your new coastal county will have its offices, facilities, and workers conveniently here on the coast. The jobs transferred will benefit our economy with salaries earned/spent on the coast.
Equitable - Your new coastal county will assure you get the county services you are paying for. The Highway 126 tunnel represents a cultural divide that separates us from Eugene; and our fair share of public safety resources and other public services. Some liken the tunnel to a worm hole between galaxies separating the coastal communities from the valley; thus we are easily ignored.
Affordable - Your new coastal county will not be burdened with over 160 years of questionable Eugene-centric decisions which have dramatically increased the cost of providing critical public safety and other essential services.  The new coastal county will not be in the financially devastating PERS.  The current fees, taxes, and federal/state revenue sharing generated by the coast and used by Eugene will remain on the coast to the benefit of the coastal communities. County services are allocated by funding and population; the coastal area has 5% the people, provides approximately 12% of the funding, and yet only receives 2-3% of the total county services.
Representative - Your new coastal county will provide 100% representation in deciding county level issues versus the current 5% the coast receives under Lane County. The 5% is based upon our choosing only one of the five commissioners, and then being only 25% of West Lane County who elect the Commissioner representing West Lane County. The West Lane District Commissioner is primarily elected by and serves the voters of the western greater Eugene area and its surrounding bedroom towns.
Oregon Revised Statues 202 allows the formation of a new county by a majority of the registered voters signing a petition for and then voting in favor of the proposed new county.

DIGNITY: restoring citizen engagement, civilized public discussion, broad acceptance of all persons to live their version of the American dream under the rule of law, and providing for those in need while promoting a culture of responsibility; LONG-TERM VIEW: ensuring fiscal responsibility in public finances, and sustainability of institutions and the environment to limit burdens on future generations by our actions of today; ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT: embrace the efficiency of free markets as the backbone of American prosperity, promote free trade and responsible immigration of talented people from around the world, embrace technological innovation to modernize government and the delivery of solutions to common needs.

1142,"Critical philosophy (which is also known as critical theory or social philosophy) is the act of thinking critically and broadly about life and culture. 
What is the objective of the Society for Critical Philosophy?  We are building a coalition of thinkers who are ready and able to interact with the assumptions that reside at the base of culture, assumptions which are assumed to be intelligent and normative, merely because they have never been identified and challenged in light of a broader social context. 
""Many ideas prevalent today are revealed to be mere illusions when we consider them from the point of view of their social basis. But it is not enough merely to correlate these ideas with some one social group... We must penetrate deeper and develop them out of the decisive historical process from which the social groups themselves are to be explained.""*  To be more specific, we seek to target controlling, authoritarian premises, which lie at the heart of popular culture; we seek to expose and refute the tactics of ideology. Our main concern is the liberation of the individual; we seek to make people aware of the culture in which they exist; we seek to impart freedom through the medium of criticism, which is a tool that can be utilized to expand consciousness. We believe social awareness is vital to freedom. ""More than ever, the proposition holds true that progress in freedom demands progress in the consciousness of freedom.""**  All our lectures are free and open to the public; we are not trying to appeal to the prejudices of society, we are not trying to form a mass movement, we are trying to create a coalition of substance, a group of lecturers that produce quality work. This is all that matters; for this reason do we exist.    If the S.C.P. is successful it will provide a platform for philosophers to share their discoveries and criticisms. Our lectures will not be confined to a limited geography, but through social media, they will be made available to the general public.    All are welcome and encouraged to attend; we are always looking for serious thinkers that want to contribute to the emancipation of culture. Our speakers are not chosen on the basis of formal education, but by their *ability* to identify and refute the controlling assumptions that drive culture. Our concern is nothing less than the deconstruction of ideology aimed at the emancipation of the individual. Our presuppositions are boldly humanistic.   The S.C.P is part of a larger philosophical movement going back to the 1930's; it is represented by the work of Theodore Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Eric Fromm and Herbert Marcuse (to name just a few). Critical philosophy goes back to Socrates, it reached a climax in the work of Karl Marx.

We’re surrounded by innovation every day. Companies and organizations that weren’t around ten years ago have revolutionized the way we travel, communicate, entertain, live, and learn. But in politics, we’re stuck with two choices that most of us don’t like. We think some innovation is long overdue to make our politics more representative of and responsive to all Americans.

This Meetup is a refuge for us to discuss how we can Make America Great Again starting here in our own backyard.

Seattle Patriots for Trump is MOBILIZING FORCE for those who are fed up with RINOs pandering to ""soft"" Democrats and who are NOT buying into the defeatist attitude that is all too common amongst conservatives in Washington. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE! 
OUR MISSION:
To elect conservatives in Washington state who will help us defend American values and Western civilization from the assaults of Marxist socialism, totalitarian governments, FAKE NEWS, and Islamist extremists. 
HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION:
Attend Meetups where you will learn more about your local government and how you can be the most effective in your area. This could mean becoming a Precinct Committee Officer or Precinct Captain in your Legislative District. It could also mean volunteering your time and talents to a campaign, rally or other event.

1177,"The Puget Sound Socialists is the Meetup group for the Seattle branch of the International Socialist Organization. The ISO is committed to building a left alternative to a world of racism, poverty, war, and environmental destruction. A socialist society where people come before profit—built from the bottom up through the struggles of ordinary people against exploitation, oppression, and injustice—is desperately needed.   In the U.S., a tiny proportion of the population enjoys fantastic wealth, while millions of people live in desperate poverty, and many more live paycheck to paycheck. Yet we have the resources to feed, clothe and educate everyone on the planet. A world free of exploitation is not only possible but worth fighting for.   The ISO stands in the tradition of revolutionary socialists Karl Marx, V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky in the belief that workers themselves—the vast majority of the population—are the only force that can lead the fight to win a socialist society. Socialism can’t be brought about from above, but has to be won by workers themselves. The Democratic Party, much like the Republicans, acts in the interests of Corporate America and the privileged few at the top, and we do not support their candidates.   We see our task as building an independent socialist organization with members organizing in our workplaces, our schools, and our neighborhoods to bring socialist ideas to the struggles we are involved in today, and the vision of a socialist world in the future. The Puget Sound Socialists District is affiliated nationally with the International Socialist Organization (ISO) the largest revolutionary organization in the U.S. with branches and members in more than 65 cities across the country.

1181,"Choose Life, not Death
We're told to avoid suffering a horrible death and excruciating pain we have to vote for Death with Dignity statutes. People don't comprehend it's completely opposite, when they agree to death statutes they're actually leaving it up to others on how and when they or their loved ones will die by taking away your choice. They know the average person trusts doctors and never comprehends it can lead to a painful death ahead of their time, regardless of age. Hospital and doctors make many mistakes, it's a proven fact, fifty percent of hospital deaths are attributable to negligence. DWD laws allow hospitals risk management to issue DNR orders and Comfort Care which are death decrees, and have nurses adjust the flow or drip of deadly comfort care medications and cause your loved one to die yet no one will ever suspect since it will appear natural, relatives get the news their loved one took a turn for the worst and praise the hospital for doing their best, not realizing their loved one was euthanized like an animal. 
They're euthanized without any criminal or civil liability, absolutely none, even if they bludgeon a person to death, it's a demonic combination of state cost cutting atatutes and in Bellingham Washington, our one catholic hospital Peacehealth St. Joseph's with their own rules called ERD's that leaves lives your life up to pedophile priest at the Vatican surfing the web. DWD laws attract the worst kind of doctors and then protect these doctors and hospitals from criminal and civil liability as a result many unsuspecting patients die ahead of their time. The doctors assume they're safe, but there's never been a Supreme Court decision allowing murder or assisted suicide and there never will be or the nation will raise up. The problem is the state of washington turns it's back and no longer protects the sanctity of life while in bed with the death mongers who promise our legislators to reduce state medical costs by eliminating children and vulnerable at every opportunuty, meanwhile the department of health is told to turn it's back on serious violations. In my wife's case, there is conclusive proof of abetting a suicide by forcing an incompetent person who was deliberately drugged and unable to comprehend or sign a medical directive as PeaceHealth risk management employees did to her, according to an eyewitness affidavit, which was contradictory to her true wishes just three days earlier. There is also proof an ER nurse told responders the husband was going to shoot them and that the wife had a DNR. All false, we never knew doctors initiated the SILENT DNR and told responders not to assist my wife, when she didn't die, a responder punctured her internal jugular vein apparently in response to the false death threats and continues to maintain they never saw the PICC line and only performed an IV on the EXTERNAL Jugular vein, despite conclusive contradictory proof from an UWMC autopsy that proves there was the puncture wound over the INTERNAL jugular vein, the purpose of a PICC line is to totally eliminate the need for other puncture wounds. Assisting medical involuntary murder or assigning comfort care without informed consent, even if they say they were only doing their job, is not an excuse by a doctor, nurse or responder or hospital employees to ever kill a person, at Nuremburg when workers tried to use that same excuse they were hung right alongside the others, mengele escaped to Brazil. 
The reason why this is happening is that Death with Dignity has been sold to our state legislators as a way to cut down on state medical costs, the state turn it's back on violations and hospitals love it, knowing it's no cost malpractice insurance for them. The tables have switched, the state use to be against euthanasia but now protects doctors who can help them as they'e politically connected, even if it means forsaking the sanctity of life of the voters who they had always put first. Now that our government has gone bankrupt and we're looked at as liabilities, once they've made a mistake or you begin collecting government pensions and social security you've worked hard for, you become a liability to the foreign owners of U.S. OF AMERICA, INC, therefore risk management departments have been given a green light to get rid of state and corporation liabilities even if it has to overlook deadly medical mistakes. 
They consider sick and vulnerable individuals they consider not productive to their bottom line as expendables, once you've done your forty years you'll be eliminated or given deadly drugs, rather than simple natural remedies, that will put you on their slippery slope yet they still make them money and new symptoms means more money for more sickness and death. We all have respect and compassion for other faiths but we have to learn from history we cannot rely on names and badges and history shows us there has always been people forced into hurting others. It can be an individual, a state, a church, municipality even a catholic hospital run by their own sets of rules that do not share beliefs in truth and always choosing life, we have to find ways to stop leaving our lives in their hands which can only lead to an untimely demise. We need to inform our state legislators they were wrong in enacting death statutes and these people who participate in assisted suicide and euthanasia have no place in a civilized society and to start enforcing laws already in place for cruel and abusive treatments, abetting suicide and murder. The people have to demand they stop or leave or face a common law court as they did at the Nuremberg trials. Questions, drop me an email, bobbynorthlake@gmail.com, I'll get back asap.

Meanwhile, there is a growing unease in our Nation. An undercurrent of fear that something has gone, Is going, terribly wrong. This fear is well founded and the breakdown in our political system is only the latest symptom.
At this point Voting for either a Democrat or a Republican is not going to Fix the breakdown in Washington. Ask yourself, has it previously?
IF, we are going to change Congress, and thereby the direction of the Nation, than we need to elect Independent voices that are not part of either political machine.

This group is for Moderate Americans who believe that neither Ideology has the final, best, word on how to govern. That the overly strict focus on strident Ideology is, in fact, a major part of the problem we face.
It's easy for the political extremes to mobilize. They are fired by the passion of their beliefs. Moderates by nature are not tied to 'the cause' (what ever it might be). They simply want what most people want. Political and Economic stability, gainful employment, and a chance to pass on a better life to their children.
While Moderates are the first to become disgusted with a broken political system it is vital to put that disgust aside and to reengage otherwise the future belongs to the extremes.
