This is a safe and open space for all to build a community in which we can support each other on this exciting journey!"
SF & Bay Area Zeitgeist movement social consciousness group,1,"At this point the purpose of this group is to gain and grow members of fellow people who see the world for what it really is and the true root cause for all of the perilous issues we face. I saw Zeitgeist Moving Forward a year ago and in that finally found something that illustrated so masterfually everything I had always thought, the documentary was mind blowing and life changing. Thank you Netflix for adding this to your library for the public to see!
 There seems to be no real forums to actually talk to other like minded people even online, which is frustrating. Most of us know the masses are not open minded enough to even realize why they have the beliefs they have. so really I  can count on my hand the number of people I know who have agree with a resource based economy, I find it harder and harder to relate to the indoctrinated masses.
So it would be really nice to see if we can get some people to join, and who are up for chatting.   And hopefully get to a point to where we can have some regular in person meetups.... And maybe attend next year's Z-Day. 
Would love for you to join, and open to any and all suggestions.
Thanks,

Adventures in History and Culture,1,"Welcome history and culture enthusiasts! Let's go explore the Bay Area's cultural treasures around us! We visit archaeological sites, museum exhibits, participate in discussions, go to historical reenactments, attend plays and operas, explore old parts of cities, visit fairs and festivals, learn skills at workshops, go on tours, enjoy movies, and more!    Everyone is welcome: families with kids, students, scholars, seniors, singles, LGBTQ, all ethnicities, people with all ranges of physical capabilities, all religious backgrounds, and those ranging from the aspiring Indiana Jones to people just rekindling their interest in history and culture.     In addition to exploring new places each month, we also have our own bookclub: (we currently need a new host for this, so please let me know if you'd be interested!)

Meeting every 6-8 weeks, we choose our own book from any genre that is related to that meeting's topic.  For example, one topic we had was the US Civil War, where people chose books covering culturally-based war tactics, Lincoln's funeral train, articles from that time, and fiction.  By having a topic that we base a variety of books choices on, we are able to have a more holistic discussion from interdisciplinary perspectives.  
We start out by everyone introducing themselves and their book with a brief description of what it was about, an interesting fact, and how they felt about it (30 seconds to two minutes each).  Then we open up to a naturally flowing discussion.  It is okay to also just sit and listen the whole time!
""Book"" is used loosely to describe a possibility of many medias: songs, films, scripts, anthologies, short stories, newspaper and journal articles, magazines, and art.
Our monthly Cuisine and Convo event:
Each month, we choose a cultural place in the world (i.e. not strictly geographical) and then find a group-friendly, highly-rated restaurant featuring traditional foods from that country. Similar to the book club, we chat about that culture in an interdisciplinary manner drawing from our own experiences of travel, books or movies, college classes, crafts, scanning trivia online, to...well, anything at all as long as it relates.
You can bring books, pictures, artifacts, or just yourself.  If you don't get a chance to look up something about that culture, you can always bring up a ""top 10"" trivia on your phone about the culture/location.  After we finish our brief show-and-tell/sharing, we open up to casual conversation about the culture or whatever topic morphs from that.
Occasionally we will host this with a concurrent cultural festival like combining the topic of Germany with an Oktoberfest celebration or Greece with a trip to the Greek Festival.
Please bring cash in case we can't split the check.  You only pay for what you ordered, but tax and tip will be divided evenly by the number of people present regardless of what you ordered.

If you can't make an event, you can still interact with us online on our group's social media:

United states have been the birth place ( incubator ) of latest technological innovations; information technology; and many inventions.

What we will do : We will guide them to take better decisions in education and professional life.

I have received unanimous support; strong endorsements and encouragement from people of senior director level to Analysts, employees of Facebook, google working class people to rich families, church going parents to bar going adults; religious aristocrats to people who believe in marijuana.

Campbell Red Solo Cup Flag Football Meetup,1,"Looking for Co-ed flag football players that are as interested in having fun yet competitive games at least once a month.
I will bring flags and prepare the field (80 yard x 30 yard) in hopes to get at least a total of 7 but no more than 12 players for every game.  RSVP spots for the games will entail $4 fee to be paid up front.  If you cancel your RSVP spot 3 days  before the game, you will be eligible for a refund of the RSVP fee.  The fees collected will go towards paying the MeetUp administrative costs and paint for the field. 
Some of the rules we play by:
- First team to 10 scores wins (with halftime at 5 scores). Games usually last about 75 minutes.
- No kickoffs. Possessions start at the 10 yard line. First downs are fixed lines at the 20, 40, and 20 yard lines.
- At least one female player on each team. - QB's are on a rotation. Everyone on the team must play QB before anyone can play QB again.
- QB's cannot scramble past the line of scrimmage at any time even if they get rushed by the defense after counting 7 ""mississippi""
The most important thing is that we all enjoy a competitive game while keeping in mind that having a fun time is the priority.  Group rules:  Understanding that life happens and unforeseen circumstances can prevent any of us from attending any particular event, a new set of group rules will be established and enforced.   Members will be removed from the group if they:  - have been inactive for more than 2 months  - RSVP for and event and cancel within 2 days more than once  - RSVP for an event and do not show up   The primary objective of the group is to get together, play football, meet new people, and have a great time.  These rules will help prevent members investing time and money to attend an event to then have it canceled due to last minute cancellations or people not showing up.  Looking forward to meeting good people and having a great time."

Hiking With Laid Back Moms And Kids...and Other Outdoor Fun,1,"This group is for chill, light hearted moms and kids who like to spend time outdoors. Whether you already spend time outdoors or want to explore the outdoors, you are welcome. Most activities won't be too strenuous or serious. My daughter is 9 years old, born in 2007. She is active and loves the outdoors. But, sometimes it's hard to motivate her to go on a hike with just me. Having other kids around always makes it more fun. I think it is important to nurture her love for the outdoors especially as she gets older and the preoccupation with the iPad increases. I plan to do one event a month with maybe some spontaneous events thrown in. Ideas I have for activities are hiking, kayaking, biking (when I finally get my hitch and bike rack), pool days, miniature golf, and potluck/BBQ at the park. I would also like to learn to play Pickle Ball...anyone know how to play already?I would love any suggestions for activities."

DaVinci Homeschool Group,1,"Welcome to the DaVinci Homeschool Group!
This friendly & supportive group is geared for families who are actively homeschooling with at least one school aged child (siblings are always welcome). We are located in the SF East Bay Area, primarily in San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Castro Valley & Hayward. Our weekly park day is on Tuesdays.
We are a secular group that encourages diversity and our members vary in homeschooling styles, religions, political views, family structures, and probably anything else you can think of. 
This group identifies as a community. Communities exist and thrive when all members are active and engaged. We are not just a network or a calendar of events, we are here for the connection. The things we do are possible because we are all working together to make this a fun, caring, and supportive homeschool community. We want to help our children build lasting friendships and at the same time build those kinds of relationships for ourselves too. 
Our weekly park day is an important part of our community and the best place to come socialize and connect with the group. We expect every member to be an active participant and require members to attend an event at least once every 60 days, but that number is a bare minimum which we hope members strive to exceed. Our intention is for those who join the group to also be looking for a community that they can identify with and actively participate in. This group is more than just an online resource, we do need to see you in person. :)
We meet for field trips, art & craft activities, park days, holiday parties, nature walks/hikes, social activities, and lots of hanging out and having fun. We feel that activities for our children are very important, but we also think that it's important for the parent who stays home to get some time to themselves too, so we have a parent's book club and a reoccurring parent's night (or day) out.
We don't offer classes or structured learning situations. To learn about those type of activities offered in the Bay Area, we recommend joining Bay Area Homeschool Field Trips (BAHFT) at "

We aim to schedule and promote evening events as well without our children for a dads night out or educational workshops.
There are not enough resources, social outlets, support groups, or services for dads in San Francisco. This group is the pioneer in achieving more for dads in San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area.
Additionally, check out our BLOG SITE to read about PLAYGROUP EXPERIENCES, RELEVANT NEWS, News articles, EVENTS, RESEARCH, WORK-LIFE BALANCE & MORE from a diverse group of dad voices:

SFDebate Political Discussion Meetup,1,"The SF Debate Meetup is an open forum for discussion on the events of our time. We have three goals UNDERSTAND OTHER POINTS OF VIEW With so much news available to us, it is easy to fall into the trap of relying on sources that simply support and reinforce our own limited beliefs. The SF Debate Meetup is a chance for you to expand your perspectives and understanding.

Thank you to everyone who helped work to pass Proposition K on the November 2008 ballot here in San Francisco to decriminalize prostitution! While we were unsuccessful this time, we did receive over 41% of the vote, and served notice once again that our movement is not going away. Next time, Liberty willing, we will win! In the meantime, the ongoing work of organizing the sex work community and supporting each other when we are targeted by government or public intolerance, bigotry, or greed for our justly acquired earnings continues... If you are new to this movement, some helpful additional information and resources can be found on the websites of the Prostitutes Education Network ( the Sex Workers Outreach Project (), Erotic Service Providers Union (), and Californians for Privacy ( Thank you for your interest and participation in this Meetup!"

Berkeley Cannabis Distribution & Cultivation Action Group,1,"Medical cannabis patients, caregivers, suppliers, cultivators, bakers, extractors, other product producers, activists, community groups, attorneys, city staff, elected officials, healthcare professionals, and business owners, will meet to discuss local cannabis issues especially cultivation, delivery, dispensaries, collectives, improving the status quo, achieving the most benefit for patients and community.
Thank you for contacting the Berkeley Cannabis Action Group. We initiated and formed from the interest of 2 current Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commissioners and several local cannabis cultivators and business operators. Specifically, we are currently primarily interested in spurring a recalcitrant Berkeley Mayor and City Council to act this fall in approving a cultivation ordinance and a cultivation licensing process in the city of Berkeley. 
     FYI, the Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commission sent their recommended cultivation ordinance to the Mayor and BCC for review, approval and passage in March of 2015. Excuses given for the delay have been the lack of state legislation, which was indeed signed by Governor Brown in Oct. 2015! 
     Regarding the cultivation licensing process, the cannabis commission cultivation subcommittee will meet Monday Aug. 22, 3:30 pm, Berkeley Planning Center, at the corner of Milvia and Center. We hope then to finalize and recommend a process to the full medical cannabis commission for approval at their Sept. 8 meeting. With commission approval, the cultivation licensing process will be sent to the Mayor and BCC for their review and passage. 
     Upon medical cannabis commission cultivation licensing process recommendation, our Action Group then will meet to discuss possible strategy and tactics to persuade the Mayor and City Council to act in accordance with other jurisdictions (SF, Oakland, Richmond, Santa Cruz), who have all passed cultivation ordinances and licensing. Incidentally, we'll be reviewing the cultivation regulations of the fore-mentioned cities at the Aug. 22, cultivation subcommittee meeting.
    In the future and down the road, our Action Group will also lobby the Mayor and City Council regarding cannabis issues such as, delivery services, nurseries, state regulation and legalization. We likewise as well, encourage public participation and attention at Berkeley medical cannabis commission meetings.

Open Forum : Philosophy and Politics Discussion,1,"An open and inclusive group for people varying stances to discuss philosophy, politics, current events, and more, in a not only civil, but mutually enjoyable manner. As I'm sure many of you have noticed, its rather difficult to find people to talk about these big ideas with, let alone in a productive manner. Its hard to get a number of people's schedules and preferences to line up, so this group is started with the intention of splinter cells forming within it based on common interests and availability."
DogPAC,1,"DogPAC of SF is a registered political action committee that focuses on the health and welfare of animals but primarily issues relating to dogs in the City & County of San Francisco and beyond.
Dog advocates are as diverse as the breeds and mutts they care for. But when it comes to caring for animals there is a passionate bond that unites people in a common movement to improve the quality of life with pets. The committee has been recognized as a vanguard in bringing about policies that benefit the larger pet population and the people who care for them.
DogPAC of SF advocates for the most pressing animal welfare issues that include greater access to housing for people with pets, shared use of parks and open space, and adequate City and County services to protect and treat animal populations. We have strong partnerships with animal shelters and rescues and with many organizations and community leaders who share a vision for animal welfare and responsible pet guardianship.
Considered one of the most pet-friendly cities, San Francisco alone has more than 150,000 dogs that are household members or waiting for an adoptive family. The entire SF Bay Area including visitor with their dogs far exceeds this many which warrants flexible policies to accommodate all.
Meetup at our events and help shape how recreation with our dogs needs to be!

Sacramento Politics and Philosophy Group,1,"This is a group for those in the Sacramento area who like to discuss politics and philosophy. We have all had different experiences in life, but we always find that political issues are very relevant to our lives and we want to discuss these issues with others. These days, political discussions are sometimes constructive, but unfortunately they often become hostile when people with differing views are in the same room. It is important for us all to hear views other than our own from time to time, and there has to be a way to have honest, thoughtful discussions on issues important to our lives while keeping the discussion calm and polite. In this discussion group, we try to avoid being overly biased when presenting opinions and we will also work to avoid use of fallacies in making points. We expect that there will be differences of opinion, but as long as we keep a philosophical mindset these discussions should not descend into hostility. Many of us also like to discuss philosophical topics and we will have time for this as well and we will probably find that most philosophical concepts have real-world applications, including political. So this discussion group will hover between these two subjects, and we might even at times focus on other subjects as well."
Oakland Social Justice Books and Beer,1,"This is a group for anyone interested in building community while reading awesome books. We'll primarily be reading books with social justice themes, or books by authors who often get left out of mainstream book clubs.

Beer, wine, or the beloved mimosa will always be an option at meet ups. Book club meetings will happen once a month, but once we get started, other fun non-book related events throughout the month are always welcome! People of any & all identities welcome. Only read part of the book? Come anyways and participate in the discussion, we all have something to say about the subjects!"

Folsom Corporatists,1,"This meetup is for people who think that white civil rights are under attack, but don't believe that racism is the answer. Here we can meet and discuss the nature of ethnic corporatism in America, and how it might be made into a more positive force in society. As corporatists, we reject supremacy in all forms, e.g. race, class, religion, ideology, etc. Tyranny of the minority and tyranny of the majority are both tyrannies.
Sweden, Denmark and Germany are corporatist states. They apply corporatism to labor/business relations; Sweden in particular is known for a high degree of collaboration between capital and labor, to (great) mutual benefit, unlike the U.S.'s adversarial model. If the Swedes can resolve their economic conflicts peacefully and without hatred, surely we Americans can learn to approach our ethnic conflicts the same way.
The purpose of this group is to educate ourselves in how we might do that.  Meetups will be based around various topics and presentations will be made."

The Magic Money Tree Project,1,"What most people know about money is wrong and this is creating massive societal problems.  The goal of the Magic Money Tree Project is to build grassroots literacy of political economics (how political and economic systems interact).  We create, share, and disseminate educational tools and materials to build literacy on key societal issues.  We work on a grassroots level to understand the issues real people face in their daily lives. We help build understanding of how political and economic systems work in ways that are relevant and understandable to them.
This project's goal is not to promote a specifically liberal or conservative agenda.  Liberals and conservatives both contribute to society.  We count them among our friends, family, members of the community, countrymen, and fellows in humanity.  We can improve society by learning to understand people different from us because we all have shared interests and goals.
This project is also not directly concerned with party politics.  However, understanding political economy opens up new possibilities for policy and political action."

Code For Democracy SF,1,"Who should join: You should join if the recent political climate has created in you a desire to ""do something"" and if you feel that a good way for you to do something will involve leveraging technology. The original Code For Democracy NYC group was founded on Jan 20th 2017, and is growing quickly. I hope and expect that we can develop a great group in SF to leverage tech for democracy, equality, and fact-based policy.
What will we do: We are brand new, so I expect that the first meetup will center around 2 goals: 1. We will brainstorm ways that we can work together to make a difference, locally or at a national level. This can be through webapps, phone apps, novel dissemination of information, donating tech services, etc. 2. We will form groups around projects of merit discussed in step 2 and get to work.
What we are NOT: 1. We are not a debate group. Of course, alignment on issues within the scope of each project will be important for efficacy and unity, but many of us spend many hours learning, debating, and evangelizing already; this group is for taking action. 2. We are not exclusive: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend and will be treated with respect."

Meetings will generally be held at public venues, usually coffee houses, sometimes in the day, sometimes in the evening, so all members can find some meetings to match their schedules.  An essential goal of our group is to enjoy our meetings in a friendly, respectful manner.   Generally speaking, the meetings will begin with WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND (open to any relevant topic), followed by a focus on one or more current issues or political development and we will try to get command of the facts, the players, and so forth on that particular issue.  Meetings may then move on to other topics.  Facilitator will usually have one or more hand-outs based on factual summaries of recent articles or books.
This group is for people who identify themselves as ""politically centrist, liberal, or progressive"" and membership is only for people who  interact with others in a friendly, respectful manner.

Learning about Life from Animals,1,"A study group of Anne Benvenuti's Spirit Unleashed: Reimagining Human-Animal Relations. Animals know things that humans have forgotten and desperately need to relearn. We'll meet at a cafe and read a page of Anne's book and share our responses. We can also talk about our own journeys and feelings.
No need to have read the book in advance, though you'll love it if you do. Time with animals and better relationships with them can heal us and help heal the planet, according to Benvenuti.  We can decide at the first meeting how our meetups will go and how we might involve animals in them."
Oakland Rescue Dog Shelter Helpers (Volunteering Meetup),1,"So many dog rescue agencies in the East Bay need help with dog walking and socialization (a.k.a. playing, cuddling, etc). This not only helps the dogs relieve stress and stay healthy, but it makes them more sociable and likely to be adopted. And every dog that is quickly moved through the shelter system is another dog saved! Plus, playing with these dogs is SO MUCH FUN! Unfortunately, with shelters short on volunteers, this does not get done nearly enough. This group is dedicated to finding creative ways to support local dog rescue agencies. We will have great volunteer opportunities that can fit with anyone's schedule. You just have to love dogs and want to help!  To streamline your acceptance into the group, please fill out the following form: www.goo.gl/N3bhXA."
Animal Charity Community Advisory Board for All Beings Co,1,"Do you love animals? Are you particularly fond of the ones we call our pets or fur babies? Do you hate thinking about the millions of pets put down every year because they are unwanted or their guardians cannot afford the emergency medical care they need?
The mission of All Beings Co is to draw awareness to the Suffering of All Beings, notably the four-legged members of our families. Our vision is to accomplish this through action, education and financial assistance.  All Beings Co is a California Public Benefit Corporation and a federally recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation serving Sacramento, CA.

San Jose Pink Pistols,1,"Begun in 2006, the San Jose Pink Pistols came into existence to encourage, educate and train the LBGT community for Self Defense.
San Jose Pink Pistols welcomes everyone comfortable with diversity.
San Jose Pink Pistols emphasizes firearms safety, skills development and conviviality.
We are a friendly, informal group of shooting enthusiasts with a reserved range event on the 4th Sunday of each month and a shared outreach beginner shooting event on the 2nd Saturday of each month..
The San Jose Municipal 10th street range is our ""home range"", it is at 1580 South 10th Street, San Jose California 95112.
In addition to our regular monthly events, we will have other outings where we will travel to other ranges.
Due to the social nature of our group, most of us have multiple guns and typically we always try out each others guns.  The custom in our group is if you are shooting someone else's gun, reimburse them for their ammunition.
For our events, we have been getting together for lunch or dinner after shooting so that we can socialize, where we go depends on mood of the group. 
Interested, but don't have a firearm? If so, this is the group to join. In our group you will find a welcoming environment for beginners, our members especially enjoy mentoring new shooters.  
Typically between all of us who attend we have a wide variety of firearms and experience.
For someone who is new to anything, often many times a new person won't even know what questions to even ask, we will help guide you to figure what questions to ask and hopefully we will have satisfactory answers to your questions.
We will show you how to shoot ""Safely"" and have a lot of ""Fun"" doing so.
And for those of you who are ""experienced shooters"", of course you are welcome and we welcome you to come share your experiences so that all of us can grow.
For those of you looking for more ""advanced training"", as a group we will be making 2 plus road trips to Front Sight Training in Pahrump, Nevada. Front Sight is 70 miles from Las Vegas. It is ""legal"" to transport firearms on commercial planes in ""screened and checked in"" baggage.
We will either buy ammo at Front Sight or one of us will drive to Pahrump.
We have a ""new sister chapter"", the Las Vegas Pink Pistols that some of their members may join us on our road trips to Front Sight.  
Other Pink Pistol chapters do exist in the United States and it is our intention to link and meet up with as many active chapters as possible. We are about growing Pink Pistols nationwide.

Santa Cruz March for Elephants,1,"Come meet with us to learn about life for elephants throughout the world. We will discuss the current crisis facing elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia, the plight of captive elephants around the globe and what we can do to help them. Currently, 35,000+ elephants are being killed by poachers each year for their tusks. At this rate, elephants in Africa will be extinct in less than 10 years. A rhino is killed at least every 11 hours for its horn. We've already lost the Western Black Rhino to extinction. With only 29,000 white rhinos remaining, we want to raise awareness about this crisis and work to stop the needless slaughter before it's too late. We will also discuss the plight of captive elephants who need us to speak out on their behalf. 
The goal of this group is to spread the word about the plight of elephants and rhinos throughout our local community through tabling, education, presentations, marching and participating in ongoing activities with March for Elephants in San Francisco. 
If you're interested in volunteering to help elephants and rhinos from becoming extinct or from living in unnecessary suffering and loneliness, please join Santa Cruz March for Elephants. You can also contact us by email at scmarchforelephants@gmail.com

San Francisco for Elephants and Rhinos,1,"Join to help end the extinction of the earth's last Elephants and Rhinos.

This is the opportunity for all San Francisco and Bay Area residents to come together to determine creative and imaginative ways on ending the ivory and rhino horn trade in California and the world.


 Did you know that California is the second largest market in the USA for illegal ivory?


 Did you know that China is the largest market for ivory in the world, and has 37+ ivory carving factories and more than 145 ivory retail outlets; a steady stream of ivory from Africa, from brutally poached elephants sustains the ivory market in China.


 Did you also know? Up to 50,000 Elephants are being killed every year so their tusks can be carved into ivory trinkets. A Rhino is slaughtered once every 9-11 hours for Rhino Horn. Their only hope for survival lies in an immediate end to the ivory and rhino horn trade (both ""legal"" and ""illegal"") and a meaningful opportunity to recover from decades of mass slaughter. The countdown to elephant and rhino extinction has begun - unless action is taken now, we will lose these majestic, highly intelligent, and emotionally sentient creatures FOREVER. Join us! March against extinction. Let's meet to discuss ways to end the trade!"

Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,1,"Saving sharks for ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.
Sharks are symbols of ocean health. Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean. Until Now.
Today many species are threatened and could go extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.

Intellectual Property Rights,1,"This MeetUp is for Businesses, Managers and Executives. 
Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. Intellectual property is divided into two categories: Industrial Property includes patents for inventions, trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications. (wipo.int) 
Intellectual property protection is critical to fostering innovation. Without protection of ideas, businesses and individuals would not reap the full benefits of their inventions and would focus less on research and development. Similarly, artists would not be fully compensated for their creations and cultural vitality would suffer as a result. (topfakes.gov)
Great fortunes have been lost due to not having a patent. Some businesses don't realize that they have created something new that can be patented, and that their patent can become a valuable asset increasing the overall worth of the company. This protection allows businesses to control their market and keep competitors at bay. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
1. Physical products and processes using them (any machine, tool, instrument, compounds, formulations, medicines, plants or any other manufactured goods, compositions or products and a methods of making and using any of these).
2. Services.
3. Specialized packaging of unique shape, color or design.
4. Slogan, name, logo, tag line.
5. Written or recorded material (books, music, operating manuals, catalogs, etc.).
6. Computer hardware, software, website or architectural materials.
7. Special design of products.
8. Plants.
9. Original art, graphic design, advertising, photography, written articles, poetry, books, music, audio or video recordings, films, or dramatic works.
10. Textile, apparel, jewelry or any other accessory designs.
Join our MeetUp and learn how to identify, expand, secure and protect IP investments. Implement practices to track and document emerging IP.

Peninsula Feminist Book Club,1,"Hello Feminists,
Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome. 
We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.
The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.
This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share,  that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.

La Nueva Causa | The New Cause (SJ),1,"UNITY | COMMUNITY | EMPOWERMENT
Our meetings will take place locally, and we will be bringing in members of the Latino/minority community to discuss our shared experiences, struggles and contributions. Together we will be building the courage to stand up for ourselves, learn self value, and take our seat at the table in a nation we have helped create. This means better futures for our children, better opportunities in the work place, and fighting for the dignity and respect we deserve. No matter what background, economic status, sexual orientation, or education you may have, you are welcome in joining La Nueva Causa-The New Cause.
Be apart of the Movement!"
The Pink Hat Resistance,1,"The Pink Hat Resistance is a Women's March inspired women's political action and empowerment group. We have monthly meetings on the third Monday of every month at 6:00 PM on the Stanford campus. Currently composed of women in the Stanford staff community, I'd like to open membership up to other women in the community. For those who cannot attend the meetings, you can still sign up for our weekly newsletter and participate on group projects. Our newsletter has updates on club activities, summaries of the meetings, the meeting packets (with lots of great info and tips), info on Bay area protests and rallies, links to fascinating news & opinion articles I recommend, and some good new items to celebrate! We also have a secret Facebook group where we post relevant articles for discussion. You can check out our website at: www.thepinkhatresistance.com"
San Jose WILPF (Women's Intl League for Peace & Freedom),1,"Wilpf San Jose is for anyone who wants to work today for peace and freedom, human rights, women's rights, and more with an organization whose founding goes back to 1915."
Oakland Cure for Capitalism,1,"This meetup seeks a practical end to wage slavery, oppression, and capitalism, and a fulfilling life for each of us along the way.
We wonder why there's so much work to be done to help the masses while most capital goes towards consolidating capital further. We battle mental illness, feelings of alienation, underemployment, and hopelessness, but have a sneaking feeling that we aren't really the problem. We've had ""good jobs"" but can't seem to shake the feeling of being ground down. We're ready for a different way. "
