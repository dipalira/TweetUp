<p>OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES <br> - Be Peaceful <br> - Be Safe <br> - Be Kind <br> - Be Respectful <br> - Be Real</p>
<p><b>Grassroots Progressive Political Activism</b></p>
<p><span>We are a people-led movement devoted to fighting for a fair economy and a just society. We combine the traditional tools of community organizing with direct lobbying and electoral politics in order to shape legislation, elect progressive candidates, and remove elected officials who serve the interests of the 1%. Large corporations and big-money interests have gained control of our elected officials and government. Our goal is to reclaim our towns, counties, and state governments from the grip of corporate interests and the excessively wealthy. It is time to reclaim our government and transform it into one that puts people and planet before profit. </span></p>
<p><span>Despite the presidential election, Cook County enjoyed some solid victories! The People's Lobby and Reclaim Chicago were instrumental in initiating a review process for all police shootings in Illinois, raising the county-wide minimum wage, completing ~65% of the canvassing for Kim Foxx, decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of cannabis, and winning ten aldermanic races including 3 new city council members among other victories. We're bringing this winning strategy to the suburbs and need your help! </span></p>
<p>Nine area candidates for a variety of offices have applied for and won the endorsement of The People's Lobby and Reclaim Chicago in January 2018. Phonebanks began January 10 and continue on Wednesdays through the primary to support their candidacies. Check our websites and Facebook pages.</p>

Our group will talk about politics, current events, and ways to take action. Better ways to start the political narrative going in a positive direction. Everyone is welcome. We will meet at various locations ranging from western suburbs and surrounding areas. I am excited about this group, there are many subtle actions we can take that can make a big difference. Looking forward to exploring this political culture with everybody.

<p>This is a group formed to work towards a better tomorrow by taking action today. We are focusing on the issues impacting communities throughout the western suburbs including districts 14 (Hultgren), 6 (Roskam), 8 (Raja) and 11 (Foster). We realize not all of these districts are within Kane County, so please do not be deterred by our name. We will offer support for all of the Fox Valley area and beyond.

<p>We are an informal, inclusive progressive social group. Meet other people in Schaumburg and surrounding suburbs who are fighting the good fight. Many liberals and progressives in the NW suburbs think they're the only ones when in reality they live in liberal-leaning neighborhoods. Come on out and meet your neighbors!</p>
<p><strong>More about the Drinking Liberally network:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://livingliberally.org/drinking"></a><a href="http://livingliberally.org/drinking"></a><a>http://livingliberall</a>...</p>
<p><strong>Subscribe</strong> <span>to the Schaumburg Drinking Liberally&nbsp;<a href="http://livingliberally.org/chapter/email_signup/43212">mailing list</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is Drinking Liberally?</strong></p>
<p>Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher. Drinking Liberally gives like-minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where you can freely talk politics.</p>
<p>While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't&nbsp;do it.</p>

<p><b>This Meetup should appeal to and draw articulate, creative, politically savvy and highly talented communicators with an irreverent sense of humor and terrific writing skills --- especially screen or stage writers, investigative journalists, short story writers, and film script developers. The Meetup will be a conspiracy to expose and share by satire, parody or otherwise, disgusting and unreported pathetic truths about the Trump Gang in a humorous or comical fashion. Much information is not being shared or highlighted by the mainstream media or blogosphere. <br> <br>• Think of this Meetup as intellectual jiu jitsu with a purpose ... to hasten the end of Trump's administration. Trump and his gang provide plenty of daily outrages to share with those not tuning in to the despotic&nbsp; regime.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>• Protests and marching are great; meanwhile, much of the public is oblivious to many truths. <br> <br>• Truths are not self-evident. The mission is to educate with humor. "If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you." --- George Bernard Shaw. <br> <br>Hope to meet in Evanston bi-weekly initially to meet new members and discuss opportunities. Thereafter, we will brainstorm ideas, determine methods, and implement projects.&nbsp;</b> <br></p>

<p>Social and discussion group for those who believe government has proved itself time and again to be a poor excuse for a way to create social order.</p>
<p>Want to be an active and informed citizen? We're the group for you!</p>
<p>The near-west suburbs are a hostile place to live for folks with conservative political views and values. Oak Park - River Forest - Elmwood Park - River Forest is a great area except everyone assumes you also supported Hillary and are happy to bash all conservative ideals at social gatherings... If I go hang with locals, I find myself biting my tongue while quietly sipping my cocktail, focusing hard on my plate of food, and glancing at my watch.</p>
<p>Ever feel like there are just too many topics you must politely avoid because you aren't a socialist, progressive, communist, or just generally a judgmental "crunchy" person?</p>
<p>If you worked hard to get this nice quality of life and don't feel one iota guilty about what you have earned by the sweat of your own brow (and probably some missed parties), I think you need to know others who are also hiding from the intolerant tolerance buffs here.</p>
<p>We will laugh at things that are funny and aren't easily offended. I believe there are a lot of us who love bacon, think the US Constitution rocks, don't care to compost or shop for "fair trade" cleaning products that don't clean well compared to the awesome ones capitalism provided, and know that funny is funny. Our humor is sometimes dark, but our skin is also thick.</p>
<p>We aren't snowflakes and we don't believe the world is a bad place if it doesn't ban peanuts, gluten, nicotine, or alcohol just because we don't care to imbibe. </p>
<p>We leave others to live in peace and just wish the majority of progressives would embrace their proud "tolerance" principles when it comes to folks like us. </p>
<p>We are underground because we must be in order to live and work in peace in one of the most self-proclaimed "tolerant" areas of the state, which tolerates all sorts of behaviors we personally would never choose for ourselves (but will fervently defend their right to live their freakish lives). Yet, it is wholly acceptable to openly disparage and cast out Republicans, Capitalists, Libertarians, Evangelical Christians, Carnivores, Constitutionalist, Gun Rights activists, and anyone who doesn't wish to "celebrate" all the crap they embrace and therefore be deem "acceptable" in their eyes.</p>
<p>Listen, we think the progressives are probably wrong and that their way of living/thinking has totally hosed up this state. We know for certain they are driving away the producing class and forcing heroes into hiding due to their militant intolerance and fervent redistribution of wealth (math is hard for some, but the numbers are indisputable). But, we will defend their right to be wrong AND suffer the consequences of your wrongness. With great liberty comes great responsibility, after all. </p>
<p>Just let us RELAX and socialize in peace and talk amongst ourselves. Let us discuss our love for America and acknowledge some fine examples of American greatness, without the condemnation and pious looks of disdain we experience at every turn in Oak Park, River Forest, Forest Park, and Elmwood Park. </p>
<p>If you are a Liberty refugee from Chicago or other surrounding suburbs, you are welcome to join in here. If the commute is worth it to you, come on! We are still closer than Galt's Gulch, after all, and you can always find our venues with one of the fantastic gifts of Capitalism on your smartphone like GoogleMaps.</p>

<p>We will laugh at things that are funny and aren't easily offended. I believe there are a lot of us who love bacon, think the US Constitution rocks, don't care to compost or shop for "fair trade" cleaning products that don't clean well compared to the awesome ones capitalism provided, and know that funny is funny. Our humor is sometimes dark, but our skin is also thick.</p>
<p>We aren't snowflakes and we don't believe the world is a bad place if it doesn't ban peanuts, gluten, nicotine, or alcohol just because we don't care to imbibe. </p>
<p>We leave others to live in peace and just wish the majority of progressives would embrace their proud "tolerance" principles when it comes to folks like us. </p>
<p>We are underground because we must be in order to live and work in peace in one of the most self-proclaimed "tolerant" areas of the state, which tolerates all sorts of behaviors we personally would never choose for ourselves (but will fervently defend their right to live their freakish lives). Yet, it is wholly acceptable to openly disparage and cast out Republicans, Capitalists, Libertarians, Evangelical Christians, Carnivores, Constitutionalist, Gun Rights activists, and anyone who doesn't wish to "celebrate" all the crap they embrace and therefore be deem "acceptable" in their eyes.</p>
<p>Listen, we think the progressives are probably wrong and that their way of living/thinking has totally hosed up this state. We know for certain they are driving away the producing class and forcing heroes into hiding due to their militant intolerance and fervent redistribution of wealth (math is hard for some, but the numbers are indisputable). But, we will defend their right to be wrong AND suffer the consequences of your wrongness. With great liberty comes great responsibility, after all. </p>
<p>Just let us RELAX and socialize in peace and talk amongst ourselves. Let us discuss our love for America and acknowledge some fine examples of American greatness, without the condemnation and pious looks of disdain we experience at every turn in Oak Park, River Forest, Forest Park, and Elmwood Park. </p>
<p>If you are a Liberty refugee from Chicago or other surrounding suburbs, you are welcome to join in here. If the commute is worth it to you, come on! We are still closer than Galt's Gulch, after all, and you can always find our venues with one of the fantastic gifts of Capitalism on your smartphone like GoogleMaps.</p>

An ancient land, India, called a land of multiple mutinies, has many possibilities for growth and innovation. Brainstorming, starting from understanding the true nature of problem, can generate new ideas and solutions.

<p><span>Find out by joining our open discussion group that is inclusive of all views (conservative, liberal, independent, libertarian, etc.).</span></p>
<p>Our Mission:</p>
<p>CPL’s Mission to foster civility and community among politically dissimilar Americans by transcending divisive media politics through mediated, face to face discussion groups that explore our shared values and interests as individuals and as a nation.</p>
<p>Our Approach (friendly, respectful, fun):</p>
<p>Our discussions provide an opportunity to share your thoughts and feelings about politics and issues, and to listen to others to better understand why American's believe what we believe (without the media filter). Too much of what we think we know about others' views is informed by what's on our screens (TV, phone, computer, etc.). Let's get together to talk In Real Life to separate fact from fiction -- while doing so we might even come up with solutions to prove that real Americans with different views can collaborate respectfully!</p>
<p>***Discussions are moderated to ensure conversations remain open and friendly. Please come prepared to listen and learn with an open mind and open heart. No judgement, just conversation.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>
<p>Rebellious Magazine for Women is Chicago's most Rebellious feminist publication. This group is for anyone interested in joining our events &amp; shenanigans, including the Annual Rebellious Magazine Feminist Prom Fundraiser. We're a diverse, inclusive &amp; fun-loving group. Sometimes we raffle off vibrators.</p>
<p>Represent Us brings together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.</p> 
<p>Representation Day is a national day of action held annually by Represent.Us chapters all across the country. On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

This is 99% group so if you are in the 1% your ideas are welcome but will not be in the majority
<p>The Urantia Book, first published by Urantia Foundation in 1955, presents us with the origin, history, and destiny of humanity. It answers questions about God, life in the inhabited universe, the history and future of this world, and it includes an uplifting narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

<p>This is a group of&nbsp;Ron Paul fans Our&nbsp;mission&nbsp;is to promote and defend the great American principles of individual liberty, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a noninterventionist foreign policy, by means of educational and social&nbsp;activities.</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>

<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you.

<p>International Workers Day, which falls on May 1st of every year, is celebrated throughout the world (with the conspicuous exception of the United States of America). This holiday finds its origins in an event which occurred in Chicago, in May of 1886, and in the travesty of justice which ensued. Please click here for a brief synopsis of the full story: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair</a></a></p>
<p>The Haymarket Society exists to make sure that the legacy bequeathed to us by our patriots, who were martyred by this event and by the miscarriage of justice which proceeded, shall not be forgotten; moreover, our mission is to assure that we shall not fail to apply the wisdom, born of the hard-learned lessons of 1886 and 1887, as humanity moves forward into the future.</p>
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

<p>This is a group of&nbsp;Ron Paul fans Our&nbsp;mission&nbsp;is to promote and defend the great American principles of individual liberty, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a noninterventionist foreign policy, by means of educational and social&nbsp;activities.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>
<p>Concerned about where the country is heading? You're not alone. Join others who care about what's happening to democracy, equality, human rights, social justice, sustainability, and other important topics. It's OK if you've never been to a protest, march, or town hall - start here. You really can make a difference.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO <br> - Join this group now <br> - Schedule one of our Meetup ideas in your neighborhood <br> - Discuss your own Meetup ideas in the group conversation</p>
<p>OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES <br> - Be Peaceful <br> - Be Safe <br> - Be Kind <br> - Be Respectful <br> - Be Real</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>
<p>Rebellious Magazine for Women is Chicago's most Rebellious feminist publication. This group is for anyone interested in joining our events &amp; shenanigans, including the Annual Rebellious Magazine Feminist Prom Fundraiser. We're a diverse, inclusive &amp; fun-loving group. Sometimes we raffle off vibrators.</p>
<p>Represent Us brings together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.</p> 
<p>Representation Day is a national day of action held annually by Represent.Us chapters all across the country. On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>
<p>3. Democratic socialist classics from authors like Adorno, Allende, Bell, Bellamy, Chavez, Chomsky, Cohen, Cole, Davis, Debs, Dewey, Du Bois, Dyson, Ehrenreich, Engels, Gramsci, Habermas, Harrington, Harvey, Hayden, Hobsbawm, Hook, Horkheimer, Howe, Judt, King, Klein, Lipset, Luxemburg, Mandela, Marable, Marcuse, Marx, Mills, Nehru, Nichols, Niebuhr, Orwell, Piven, Rawls, Rorty, Russell, Shaw, Thomas, Thompson, Trotsky, the Webbs, West, Wilson, Zinn - or any others suggested by members! (I am no expert on the subject, and, after a political slumber, am only beginning to develop my knowledge of it.) </p>
<p><span>We can organize the reading list democratically, with choice of selection by consensus or by a rotating member.</span><br>

</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

This is 99% group so if you are in the 1% your ideas are welcome but will not be in the majority

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.

<p>International Workers Day, which falls on May 1st of every year, is celebrated throughout the world (with the conspicuous exception of the United States of America). This holiday finds its origins in an event which occurred in Chicago, in May of 1886, and in the travesty of justice which ensued. Please click here for a brief synopsis of the full story: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair</a></a></p>
<p>The Haymarket Society exists to make sure that the legacy bequeathed to us by our patriots, who were martyred by this event and by the miscarriage of justice which proceeded, shall not be forgotten; moreover, our mission is to assure that we shall not fail to apply the wisdom, born of the hard-learned lessons of 1886 and 1887, as humanity moves forward into the future.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>We are a passionate group dedicated to ending violence and spreading a culture of peace with local and global communities.</p> 
<p>If you love peace and desire to be the change - please join us in our campaign!</p>
<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>
<p>Rebellious Magazine for Women is Chicago's most Rebellious feminist publication. This group is for anyone interested in joining our events &amp; shenanigans, including the Annual Rebellious Magazine Feminist Prom Fundraiser. We're a diverse, inclusive &amp; fun-loving group. Sometimes we raffle off vibrators.</p>
<p>Represent Us brings together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.</p> 
<p>Representation Day is a national day of action held annually by Represent.Us chapters all across the country. On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>
<p>3. Democratic socialist classics from authors like Adorno, Allende, Bell, Bellamy, Chavez, Chomsky, Cohen, Cole, Davis, Debs, Dewey, Du Bois, Dyson, Ehrenreich, Engels, Gramsci, Habermas, Harrington, Harvey, Hayden, Hobsbawm, Hook, Horkheimer, Howe, Judt, King, Klein, Lipset, Luxemburg, Mandela, Marable, Marcuse, Marx, Mills, Nehru, Nichols, Niebuhr, Orwell, Piven, Rawls, Rorty, Russell, Shaw, Thomas, Thompson, Trotsky, the Webbs, West, Wilson, Zinn - or any others suggested by members! (I am no expert on the subject, and, after a political slumber, am only beginning to develop my knowledge of it.) </p>
<p><span>We can organize the reading list democratically, with choice of selection by consensus or by a rotating member.</span><br>

</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>

<p>This is the local chapter for Solidarity Sundays, a nationwide network of more then 200 Progressive, feminist, anti-racist activist groups committed to resisting and working for peace, justice, and equity. On the second Sunday of each month, we gather in homes across the country to:</p> 
<p>• ENGAGE with elected officials (via letters, emails, phone calls, social media, and in-person meetings)</p> 
<p>• EDUCATE through sharing relevant articles, Webinars, lecture series and special guests at meetings</p> 
<p>• AMPLIFY the action items of existing progressive organizations.</p> 
<p>• BUILD communities of empowered, educated, organized feminist activists</p>
<p>Meet others, city-wide and in the suburbs, who are interested in the topic of Feminism. Discuss current issues, such as equal rights, politics, and standing up for what you believe.</p>
<p>We are a dedicated group of citizens working to create meaningful climate action on a national level by empowering individuals to realize their personal and political power. The legislation we're working toward has bipartisan support among scientists and economists, and (increasingly!) the public.

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
<p>International Workers Day, which falls on May 1st of every year, is celebrated throughout the world (with the conspicuous exception of the United States of America). This holiday finds its origins in an event which occurred in Chicago, in May of 1886, and in the travesty of justice which ensued. Please click here for a brief synopsis of the full story: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair</a></a></p>
<p>The Haymarket Society exists to make sure that the legacy bequeathed to us by our patriots, who were martyred by this event and by the miscarriage of justice which proceeded, shall not be forgotten; moreover, our mission is to assure that we shall not fail to apply the wisdom, born of the hard-learned lessons of 1886 and 1887, as humanity moves forward into the future.</p>
<p>This is the local chapter of fairvote.org, an organization dedicated to reforming our voting system and instituting Ranked Choice Voting.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>
<p>Rebellious Magazine for Women is Chicago's most Rebellious feminist publication. This group is for anyone interested in joining our events &amp; shenanigans, including the Annual Rebellious Magazine Feminist Prom Fundraiser. We're a diverse, inclusive &amp; fun-loving group. Sometimes we raffle off vibrators.</p>
<p>Represent Us brings together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.</p> 
<p>Representation Day is a national day of action held annually by Represent.Us chapters all across the country. On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>
<p>3. Democratic socialist classics from authors like Adorno, Allende, Bell, Bellamy, Chavez, Chomsky, Cohen, Cole, Davis, Debs, Dewey, Du Bois, Dyson, Ehrenreich, Engels, Gramsci, Habermas, Harrington, Harvey, Hayden, Hobsbawm, Hook, Horkheimer, Howe, Judt, King, Klein, Lipset, Luxemburg, Mandela, Marable, Marcuse, Marx, Mills, Nehru, Nichols, Niebuhr, Orwell, Piven, Rawls, Rorty, Russell, Shaw, Thomas, Thompson, Trotsky, the Webbs, West, Wilson, Zinn - or any others suggested by members! (I am no expert on the subject, and, after a political slumber, am only beginning to develop my knowledge of it.) </p>
<p><span>We can organize the reading list democratically, with choice of selection by consensus or by a rotating member.</span><br>

</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>

On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

<p>The Urantia Book, first published by Urantia Foundation in 1955, presents us with the origin, history, and destiny of humanity. It answers questions about God, life in the inhabited universe, the history and future of this world, and it includes an uplifting narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

If door is not open, ring the bell.&nbsp;<b>Look for the signs directing you to the Gallery Room on the second floor.&nbsp;</b>After entering, immediately turn left and proceed up one flight of stairs.

<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>
<p>3. Democratic socialist classics from authors like Adorno, Allende, Bell, Bellamy, Chavez, Chomsky, Cohen, Cole, Davis, Debs, Dewey, Du Bois, Dyson, Ehrenreich, Engels, Gramsci, Habermas, Harrington, Harvey, Hayden, Hobsbawm, Hook, Horkheimer, Howe, Judt, King, Klein, Lipset, Luxemburg, Mandela, Marable, Marcuse, Marx, Mills, Nehru, Nichols, Niebuhr, Orwell, Piven, Rawls, Rorty, Russell, Shaw, Thomas, Thompson, Trotsky, the Webbs, West, Wilson, Zinn - or any others suggested by members! (I am no expert on the subject, and, after a political slumber, am only beginning to develop my knowledge of it.) </p>
<p><span>We can organize the reading list democratically, with choice of selection by consensus or by a rotating member.</span><br>

</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>

<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>International Workers Day, which falls on May 1st of every year, is celebrated throughout the world (with the conspicuous exception of the United States of America). This holiday finds its origins in an event which occurred in Chicago, in May of 1886, and in the travesty of justice which ensued. Please click here for a brief synopsis of the full story: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair</a></a></p>
<p>The Haymarket Society exists to make sure that the legacy bequeathed to us by our patriots, who were martyred by this event and by the miscarriage of justice which proceeded, shall not be forgotten; moreover, our mission is to assure that we shall not fail to apply the wisdom, born of the hard-learned lessons of 1886 and 1887, as humanity moves forward into the future.</p>
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
<p>Concerned about where the country is heading? You're not alone. Join others who care about what's happening to democracy, equality, human rights, social justice, sustainability, and other important topics. It's OK if you've never been to a protest, march, or town hall - start here. You really can make a difference.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO <br> - Join this group now <br> - Schedule one of our Meetup ideas in your neighborhood <br> - Discuss your own Meetup ideas in the group conversation</p>
<p>OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES <br> - Be Peaceful <br> - Be Safe <br> - Be Kind <br> - Be Respectful <br> - Be Real</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>

<p>Represent Us brings together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.</p> 
<p>Representation Day is a national day of action held annually by Represent.Us chapters all across the country. On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>

</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed!

On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>
<p>3. Democratic socialist classics from authors like Adorno, Allende, Bell, Bellamy, Chavez, Chomsky, Cohen, Cole, Davis, Debs, Dewey, Du Bois, Dyson, Ehrenreich, Engels, Gramsci, Habermas, Harrington, Harvey, Hayden, Hobsbawm, Hook, Horkheimer, Howe, Judt, King, Klein, Lipset, Luxemburg, Mandela, Marable, Marcuse, Marx, Mills, Nehru, Nichols, Niebuhr, Orwell, Piven, Rawls, Rorty, Russell, Shaw, Thomas, Thompson, Trotsky, the Webbs, West, Wilson, Zinn - or any others suggested by members! (I am no expert on the subject, and, after a political slumber, am only beginning to develop my knowledge of it.) </p>
<p><span>We can organize the reading list democratically, with choice of selection by consensus or by a rotating member.</span><br>

</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

This is 99% group so if you are in the 1% your ideas are welcome but will not be in the majority
<p>The Urantia Book, first published by Urantia Foundation in 1955, presents us with the origin, history, and destiny of humanity.

<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>

On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>
<p>We might read: </p>
<p>1. Contemporary texts like Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's "The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies," Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler's "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think," Joseph Stiglitz's "The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future," Matt Taibbi's "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap," Richard Wolff's "Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism," David Harvey's "Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism," Arundhati Roy's "Capitalism: A Ghost Story," Michael Mandelbaum's "The Road to Global Prosperity," Luigi Zingales's "A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity," John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's "The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State," or Timothy Geithner's "Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises."</p>
<p>2. Economics or economic history classics from authors like Appleby, Becker, Blaug, Collier, Cowen, Easterly, Eichengreen, Ferguson, Frieden, Friedman, Hayek, Heilbroner, Keynes, Krugman, Landes, Lind, Mankiw, Nasar, Polanyi, Rodrik, Rothbard, Sachs, Schumpeter, Shiller, Smith, Stiglitz, von Mises.</p>
<p>3. Democratic socialist classics from authors like Adorno, Allende, Bell, Bellamy, Chavez, Chomsky, Cohen, Cole, Davis, Debs, Dewey, Du Bois, Dyson, Ehrenreich, Engels, Gramsci, Habermas, Harrington, Harvey, Hayden, Hobsbawm, Hook, Horkheimer, Howe, Judt, King, Klein, Lipset, Luxemburg, Mandela, Marable, Marcuse, Marx, Mills, Nehru, Nichols, Niebuhr, Orwell, Piven, Rawls, Rorty, Russell, Shaw, Thomas, Thompson, Trotsky, the Webbs, West, Wilson, Zinn - or any others suggested by members! (I am no expert on the subject, and, after a political slumber, am only beginning to develop my knowledge of it.) </p>
<p><span>We can organize the reading list democratically, with choice of selection by consensus or by a rotating member.</span><br>

</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

This is 99% group so if you are in the 1% your ideas are welcome but will not be in the majority
<p>The Urantia Book, first published by Urantia Foundation in 1955, presents us with the origin, history, and destiny of humanity. It answers questions about God, life in the inhabited universe, the history and future of this world, and it includes an uplifting narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>
<p>Concerned about where the country is heading? You're not alone. Join others who care about what's happening to democracy, equality, human rights, social justice, sustainability, and other important topics. It's OK if you've never been to a protest, march, or town hall - start here. You really can make a difference.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO <br> - Join this group now <br> - Schedule one of our Meetup ideas in your neighborhood <br> - Discuss your own Meetup ideas in the group conversation</p>
<p>OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES <br> - Be Peaceful <br> - Be Safe <br> - Be Kind <br> - Be Respectful <br> - Be Real</p>

<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>

<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed!

<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>

<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>

<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Both political parties have some valuable ideas to offer, but politicians on both sides are too busy operating at the fringes of their own party to get anything done. We need to shake up the system with independents as well as left-leaning and right-leaning moderates!</p>
<p>Come out to chat about politics, make some friends with similar views, and help make an impact!</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

This is 99% group so if you are in the 1% your ideas are welcome but will not be in the majority
<p>The Urantia Book, first published by Urantia Foundation in 1955, presents us with the origin, history, and destiny of humanity. It answers questions about God, life in the inhabited universe, the history and future of this world, and it includes an uplifting narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

<p>Obama for Technology | Technology for Obama was created on My.BarackObama.com in February 2007 shortly after Barack Obama announced his intentions to run for President of the United States of America (POTUS). We are the "original" Technology for Obama group (just Google "Technology for Obama" or "Obama For Technology" and watch the videos, etc). Because I organize several Meetups, I've decided create this "Technology For Obama" Meetup Group to help get President Barack Obama reelected in 2012. Meetings will be held in my downtown Loop Chicago office. More details to follow. Join me in getting POTUS reelected so he can finish what he started and we can get the Jobs Act passed! Are you in?</p>
<p>People who are looking for an outlet from the current political climate and an opportunity to discuss activism opportunities and/or just vent. This group is right for you if...</p>
<p>1) You feel overwhelmed with the daily onslaught of crazy, coming out of the White House.</p>
<p>2) You are welcoming and respectful of people no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual identity.</p>
<p>Protest is the new brunch.</p>
<p>But, we still want actual brunch too! We meet for monthly brunches at different restaurants in neighborhoods across the city. At brunch we partake in eggs, beverages of all kinds, and small actions to further the progressive agenda in this country.</p>
<p>If you think our country is falling apart because liberals and conservatives don't know how to talk to each other anymore, you’re right, and this meetup is for you. Here, we attempt to foster conversation across the liberal/conservative DMZ, focusing as much on casual experiences as on deeper conversations about the nature of politics and our political system.</p> 
<p>Group leadership includes members from across the political spectrum, and all ideologies are welcome -- leftist to libertarian, tea party to teamster.</p>
<p>Help people vote their 'educated' opinions on issues local to Chicagoland.<br>National issues are NOT encouraged.<br>State issues are encouraged.</p>
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States, and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.
This is a group to get together and learn about the issues of the day in a social -meet people- learn & - respect others venue.

This is 99% group so if you are in the 1% your ideas are welcome but will not be in the majority
<p>The Urantia Book, first published by Urantia Foundation in 1955, presents us with the origin, history, and destiny of humanity. It answers questions about God, life in the inhabited universe, the history and future of this world, and it includes an uplifting narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Urantia Book&nbsp;portrays our relationship with God the Father. All human beings are the sons and daughters of a loving God and therefore brothers and sisters in the family of God. The book provides new spiritual truth for modern men and women and a pathway to a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>Building on the world's religious heritage,&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;describes an endless destiny for humankind, teaching that living faith is the key to personal spiritual progress and eternal survival. It also describes God’s plan for the progressive evolution of individuals, human society, and the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Many people around the world have said that reading&nbsp;The Urantia Book&nbsp;has profoundly inspired them to reach deeper levels of spiritual growth. It has given them new meaning to life and the desire to be of service to humanity.</p>

<p>This is a group of&nbsp;Ron Paul fans Our&nbsp;mission&nbsp;is to promote and defend the great American principles of individual liberty, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a noninterventionist foreign policy, by means of educational and social&nbsp;activities.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Making friends with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opportunity for Chicago area cannabis consumers to get together and be social. Too often cannabis consumption has been looked down upon and laws have kept people indoors. We're all about connecting people in community to break down stereotypes and social stigma.</p>
<p>With medical cannabis dispensaries open and laws changing in Illinois this is our time to get together and have some fun.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot yet consume cannabis in public, but this will be a great opportunity for us all to meet more like minded people.</p>
<p>We will have some events at local restaurants, bars, beaches, and even some private homes.</p>
<p>Please join and we will schedule some times and dates to get together.</p>
<p>Our boundaries are ground rules for this community to grow sustainably and maintain a safe space for all cannabis consumers.</p>
<p>• no onsite consumption of cannabis during the event<br></p>
<p>• nonviolent communication and conflict resolutions<br></p>
<p>• mutual respect for everyone in our community<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Living in Chicago as a conservative has got me empathizing with Johnathon Living Seagull. Just wanted to meet up with some like minded people who wouldn't accuse me of hating old people because I want to control my own retirement, or hating kids because I support choice in education. <br>Fair warning, I'm more of a conservative libertarian/ classical liberal, but in this city I'm not alienating anyone who doesn't want to light tax money on fire.<br>If you, like me, are feeling like the last sane person in a psych ward, let me know and we can grab a beer or something.</p>
<p>Meet Libertarians near you! Come to The Libertarian Party of Chicago Meetup to share your opinions on today's political climate and issues and learn how you can contribute to America's political future. Everyone interested in Libertarianism is welcome! Visit <a href="http://www.lpchicago.org" class="linkified">http://www.lpchicago.org</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/chicagolp">http://www.facebook.com/chicagolp</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We are a passionate group dedicated to ending violence and spreading a culture of peace with local and global communities.</p> 
<p>If you love peace and desire to be the change - please join us in our campaign!</p>
<p>In just the first 10 days of his Presidency, Donald Trump has <b>threatened undocumented immigrants</b> with deportation, <b>banned Muslim refugees</b> and legal residents from seven countries and threatened to rollback decades of <b>climate-change policy</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you believe politically, these policies must be resisted.</p>
<p>As programmers, we can offer technical capabilities to civic groups that are on the front-lines of protecting those most affected by these policies. The goal is to organize a rapid-response team of programmers, web-developers and engineers from Chicago that can build tools and applications to aide sister-organizations scale their efforts.</p>
<p>First sprint-planning meeting is next week.</p>
<p>Rebellious Magazine for Women is Chicago's most Rebellious feminist publication. This group is for anyone interested in joining our events &amp; shenanigans, including the Annual Rebellious Magazine Feminist Prom Fundraiser. We're a diverse, inclusive &amp; fun-loving group. Sometimes we raffle off vibrators.</p>
<p>Represent Us brings together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.</p> 
<p>Representation Day is a national day of action held annually by Represent.Us chapters all across the country. On Sunday, April 15, we are convening local groups and individuals working on democracy reform for a social event to to celebrate local successes and strengthen the anti-corruption movement in Illinois.</p>
<p>This group is for anyone interested in reading about economics in general or about social democracy/democratic socialism, broadly speaking, with no fixed ideology of any kind. People from any political background are welcome!</p>

<p>Guns Save Life is a regional civil rights organization that works to educate the public about the benefits of firearm ownership. The group had its origins as a county grassroots committee of the Illinois State Rifle Association in about 1995, initially meeting in Rantoul, and later holding its monthly meetings in the Jolly Roger restaurant in Urbana, IL. GSL was later incorporated as its own non-profit corporation and today represent gun owners in Illinois, Indiana and beyond in proactive grassroots activism promoting and defending firearm rights and the civil right of self-defense. Guns Save Life’s Mission statement: To promote and educate the youth of America in the use of firearms and gun safety. To educate the population regarding the safe use of firearms and the history of firearms as they shaped our country from the pioneers through various wars to the present. To promote and encourage shooting sports available to all who wish to enjoy their benefits by offering hunter safety and marksmanship programs. To encourage the building of public shooting facilities to further educate the general population and those in politics who lack the knowledge of safe use of firearms and their importance to the well-being of the general public.</p>
