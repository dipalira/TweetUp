**Abstract** â€”This paper proposes a new method of recommending events and twitter accounts to follow, by fusing the best features of two social medias- Twitter and Meetup. We aim to connect people possible having similar social interest, who can potentially meet and increase the impact in their communities. This would help in increasing the number of social movements and social reform campaigns in community. We answer three main questions in this paper, - Do people share same ideas on both social media, Can we recommend meetups based on users profile, Is it better to recommend users from twitter or from meetup
