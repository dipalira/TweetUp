San Francisco Wine Lovers Group,1,"This group is for the general public to enjoy wine and socialize. Whatever wine you like is OK here, because this group is not for the wine industry or the ""wine expert"" snobs. The organizer is not part of the wine industry and does not take money or gifts from the wine industry, e.g., no web site sponsors. Therefor, we don't promote or push any wine brands on our web site.
We only go to nice QUIET uncrowded venues. None of our photos are of paid professional models, just us. Our wine meetups are usually close to BART stations to make it easy for people around the Bay Area to attend.
This wine group puts the wine drinkers 1st, the wine 2nd, the wine industry 3rd, and the ""wine experts"" last. I have turned down all wine industry companies, about 20, offering me money to promote their services on this web site.
UNCORKING NEWS:  August 10th:  We go to the Barrel Room wine bar which recently moved to the historic building at 415 Sansome Street, San Francisco.

The Walnut Creek Area Dining Out & Social Group,1,"Hi there!

The Walnut Creek Area Dining Out Meetup is about a few things:

1. People. We're all social people who enjoy making new freinds and having a good time and that's the first goal of our meetups. 
2. Good food. Whether it be an exciting new restaurant, ethnic food, high-end or a cheap-eat, or simply an easy favorite, this group is about enjoying food.  If there's a place you love, send a suggestion and we'll get it on the schedule!
3. Expand our world - whether through food, or people or through the mere act of getting out and doing something you might not normally do, getting together with a group of new people and getting to know each other is expanding your life beyond it's current place.  
4. Fun!  Most importantly, we're here to have fun.  This is an easy, pressure free way to have a good time relax, socialize, party, indulge... it's whatever we make it.

We'll aim for Thurs/Fri/Saturday meetups, but we're also going to have weekday meetups as well.

In addition, we won't always be having full ""dinner"" meetups.  Let's be honest - some of us enjoy a good plate of nachos over a couple of beers and cocktails.  Check our the calendar and see what's coming up!"

North Bay Sailing Meetup Group,1,"It's easy to make sailing friends here!  We are the original sailing Meetup group in the Bay Area, and the largest and most active.  We try to offer inexpensive sailing opportunities for everyone.   All of our events are free, unlike other groups, which exist to charge people to sail.  The only time we charge people is when the event is a charter-share and everyone ""chips in"" on the cost to charter the boat.  We don't believe in using the Meetup platform to run a business.
You don't have to know how to sail to be part of the group.  People with boats usually always welcome guests aboard to help pull ropes and turn cranks and pass out beer.  That is called ""crewing"".
The purpose of this meetup group is to promote and share the passions of sailing. Anyone interested in sailing may join. The variety of scheduled events can help build up your sailing social circle, which is one of the keys to more sailing. Educational, social, and actual sailing events will be fun and allow members to meet each other.
Here is a great little example of some fast sailing and what one of our events is like: 
If you no-show to an actual sailing event, or prevent others from sailing if you change your RSVP to no within 48 hours of a sailing event, you could be removed from the group..
Please update your RSVP in time so the boat owners and captains can plan accordingly. This is a little courtesy to your fellow meetup members to make planning easier and not waste limited seats on a boat."

- ¡VIVA MI GENTE!
BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC  provides ways to track down the specific classes, DJ nights and live music nights you're interested in. Just check with us periodically to find different events and/or meetups or the venues that play a lot of bachata... or a mambo ""on 2"" class. 
""Where?""
From all over the bay area, of course. The city by the bay La Salsa Vive 
""When?""
We started with this site back in 2007, and in 2010 we had a boom! Since then, the scene has steadily expanded, with many new venues and studios. The old directory became difficult to use and lacked the capacity to incorporate studio classes and special events. In April 2011, I created BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC to better meet these needs. 
""Why?""
Because I love to dance salsa... and so do you. In short all tropical and regional music will be featured here.
""Where do I send my updates?""
Send your updates to rig@vivamigente.net 
""Can I purchase advertising for my club/studio/salsa CD/etc. on BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC ?""
Definitely. Drop me a line rig@vivamigente.net to discuss it. 
""What's next for BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC ?""
Many more features are planned... but that would be telling, wouldn't it. 
""Who's in charge here?""
DJ Jazzy Jezz is the main man who is a dedicated social dancer and salsa fanatic, dj, promoter…baby sitter…etc. 
He lives in FRISCO, drinks entirely too much has all the smart moves.

Many thanks to all the salseros, who kept ‘SOUTH BAY SALSA’, alive for the past years, and we welcome everyone to a new exciting phase.

Walking in San Francisco for Health and History,1,"See legal disclaimer at bottom of text. EVERYONE MAY NOW JOIN THE GROUP EXCEPT THOSE FEW WHO WERE BANNED. Walking or hiking. Meet other local people who are interested in walking or hiking for fitness and learning about San Francisco's history, including its movie history. This walking group is unique. It is primarily a health group with a dash of history talk for flavor. It is for people in average physical shape who need restroom stops and not for athletes or people with serious medical conditions.
We keep our group together. We go on many different urban walks, in the best areas, that vary greatly in amounts of climbing and history facts. We walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes at a walk's end we have an optional dinner together at a fine restaurant, usually Indian, reasonably priced.
Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley & Alameda.
We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. 99 out of every 100 doctors say ""JOIN THIS GROUP!""
NEWS:  We have a walk scheduled for Saturday, March 17th. 
Our ""group photo"" was taken July 5th, 2015 at our walk ""The March to the Sea.""

Oakland Pathways Volunteers,1,"We hope to fill Oakland's need to improve the city's many hidden pathways/stairways. At first we will remove the plant growth that is harming the pathways. Later we can do other things to improve them by such things as planting flowering plants. It is time to get local people together to improve Oakland.
We have already done 15 group weed cleanups which greatly improved 3 pathway/stairways in Oakland's Lakeshore Neighborhood plus one in the Upper Rockridge Neighborhood.
We did our first improvement to a pathway in Oakland on Sunday, May 20, 2012, and it was a success. 3 of our group showed up to work on our first pathway which was between Balfour & Calmar. Then a close neighbor we did not know saw us and joined us in removing the weeds. Our team of 4 did a great job as you may see in our photos. Since then some of our cleanups have had as many as 7 people.

East Bay Book Club,1,"About the East Bay Book Club
The East Bay Book Club is a very dynamic group of individuals who share one thing in common: an enthusiasm for books. Each month, members read a particular book, chosen by the whole group or by the Organizer, and meet to share observations, insights, and personal thoughts about it. Meetings are devoted to various genres, both contemporary and classic.
The club's members represent a variety of backgrounds and literary tastes, bringing wonderful diversity to each book discussion. The East Bay Book Club thrives on both the celebration of literature and the comraderie of its readers. More importantly, the club values the ideas of its members, allowing everyone a chance to suggest books and other ideas for making this club a lively group to participate in.
Since its inception in June 2007, the East Bay Book Club has inspired new and ongoing interest in reading. The club reads everything from historical fiction and literary works to thrillers and nonfiction. Thanks to its members, the club continues to be an engaging book interest group, discussion forum, and social club all rolled into one. The mission of the East Bay Book Club is simple: provide an opportunity to explore the excitement of literature, one of humankind's oldest forms of leisure, and to meet like-minded people along the way.
Reading Schedule
All book discussion meetings for a single club year (September through June) are announced before the start of the year. Please refer to the complete list of current and upcoming meetups to know the books and dates for each meeting. You are encouraged to plan in advance your readings of books that interest you, instead of waiting for email announcements of each meeting.

Sacramento Area Golfers,1,"Welcome to the Sacramento Area Golfers (SAG). We are a group of intermediate to advanced golfers who enjoy participating in golfing events in and around the Sacramento area. We usually play 18 holes but on occasion will play a 9 hole course after work, or join group practice sessions to build on our golfing skills.  We try to follow USGA guidelines to the best of our abilities.  The bottom line is, we just want to golf, enjoy each other's company, and have fun!  Oh ...but we DO try to observe the basics of golfing etiquette.   
In order to play an 18 hole course with SAG, you should be able to consistently hit a minimum of 115 yards from the tee box, make each hole within twice the number of par strokes, and have an average score below 110.  If you're score is closer to 115-130 you will need to increase your skill level before playing 18 holes with SAG.   Please know the basic rules of golf and golf etiquette before you play with our group.   
Being focused on your ""Pace of Play"", playing ""Ready Golf"", and adhering to golf etiquette are very important concepts in our group. Less experienced golfers can play well with more experienced golfers when these rules are followed.  Please be aware of our RSVP cancellation policy:  any RSVP cancellation within 24 hours of an event, for any reason, is considered a ""No-Show"".  Members will be expected to pay SAG for their green fee for all cancellations within 24 hours.  Members are removed from SAG after three ""no-Shows"".

The Oakland/East Bay Happy Hour,1,"Welcome to Oakland Happy Hour.
We meet most Thursday evenings and visit a different clubs, bars and pubs, near BART, and in Oakland. Our target age range is 30's and 40's.
However.....

we do also travel to other Bay Area locations in the East Bay like Berkeley and Alameda.
We sometimes have social events having nothing to do with happy hour.
We also occasionally have events on other days of the week, and
we do allow people of all ages to join.

We're kind of free flowing like that with very little structure and very few rules. This is meant to be a fun relaxed atmosphere. There are none of the following:

No membership dues,
No name tags,
No opportunists with sales pitches,
No a person taking role with a clip board and
No giant banners or signs.

We're just there to meet and have fun. It is not necessary to arrive on time for our events; arrive when you can. We do ask that you please RSVP if you might be attending so that we can alert the bar as to how many people to expect to be there and so I can try to negotiate specials with future venues. Our numbers are our discounts and the Oakland Happy Hour is all about discounts when we can get them.
Please be clear, we are not a singles meetup. This group is about meeting new friends and having a good time. Although I do know that people have started dating after meeting in this group, please do not come with the expectation of ""hooking-up."" If I get enough complaints, cougars and cheese-balls will be booted.
As mentioned before, we have no signage. Please try to look for the Organizer on your first visit. We never put up a sign but are always easy to find with very little effort. you just have to ask. I have found that people in this group are incredibly friendly and very easy to talk to. You just have to show up and order a drink.
Occasionally an organizer tip box may come out to help pay for the website maintenance. Please feel free to contribute only if you had a good time and it will not impede the purchase of your next drink.
Cheers,
Rick"

The Bay Area Sushi & Sake Aficionado Group,1,"Meet other sushi and sake addicts in your area! We'll try different sushi places around the peninsula, attack the fish, drink up some sake, and then rattle our blah blah of what we think about the restaurant - or life in general....
The event limit is 15 people (occasionally more if venue capacity allows), depending on the place, we might have to sit in separate tables (hardly any sushi place can accommodate 15 people in one table). We order a few things and share with our table mates. I will split the check (whatever remaining balance beyond the prepaid fee), divide the food + tax + tips equally and clean up your wallet. Drinks will be paid separately to be fair for those who don't drink but still would like to get fishy.
I am taking the group on average 3-5 times a month cruising up and down from San Jose to San Francisco, coast to inland from the Peninsula to East Bay, to explore legendary sushi and sake spots, hidden gems, and unexpected findings. This is for some serious and adventurous sushi fanatics, needless to say ""California Roll"" and ""Cream Cheese"" are not in our vocabularies, although we'd welcome some eccentric blends. Join this Meetup if you fit the profile ;-)

The San Francisco Bay Area CHOCOLATE Meetup,1,"What food inspires passion and excitement in your? If you say, ""chocolate,"" then this is the Meetup group for you.
Meet with people who love chocolate? eating it, tasting it, trying it, cooking with it, and living with really great chocolate.

Really! Suggest something!
And when it comes to Board Games...I am often asked ""What kind of Games do you play?""  A pretty accurate answer to ""What kind of board games do we play"" is:  ""Euro-Strategy games, as found on BoardGamesGeek.com.""
That is not necessarily the most helpful answer, tho.  The actual range of games vary from super-simple (learn in 5 minutes, play in 10 minutes) to very involved (learn in 45 minutes, play in 4 hours, takes a dozen games before you really ""get it"")...So, chances are if you think to yourself ""I like playing board games""...you'll probably find someone here who likes what you like :-)
***Check our Calendar!***
There's so many events per month, it's the only way to know what's coming up! We're all busy professionals, normal people, who want to make the most of our time away from work. We want to do more with our evenings than just sip a drink and check out the cuties in a bar. We want to take a break from trying to hook-up and just have fun together. Since we're not focused on trying to hook-up, single people and coupled people and even N-tupled people can freely join in and we'll all enjoy greater fun.
Many Events are in private home venues, for a very relaxed and comfortable interaction. These events include food, drink, and always interesting people.
If you have an interesting event you'd like to run or host, please contact me (Paul++) and we'll find a way for you to run an event."

Classic Literature and Cafes Book Club,1,"I'm hoping to combine two things that I love: Literature and discussion about literature that takes place in a relaxed cafe atmosphere (nothing too fancy here & drinking is optional). A nice way to meet other literature lovers and smart conversationalists.
Come and join the fun and expand your horizons a bit when it comes to literature! I need motivation at times to complete my reading list and maybe you do too? I'm a fan of classic literature (think Aeschylus, Dostoyevsky, Mann, Balzac, Cervantes, Goethe, Hardy, Faulkner) who has a special fondness for modernist and postmodernist writing (e.g., Brautigan, Broch, Breton, Celine, Kundera, Joyce, Rilke, Woolf, Zamyatin, Pynchon, Acker, Cortazar, Ellison, Pamuk, Calvino, Kluge, Garcia-Marquez). If you, like me, are also a fan of thought-provoking foreign/experimental 'art' cinema, you should check out my Radical Visions Cinema Club: "
Oakland Sailing Meetup Group,1,"Meet Sailors, from salty souls to those who have never tried it, join us and go sailing. Our group often includes folks from our sponsors school of folks that just finished or are taking classes getting ready to enjoy this combination of sport & lifestyle. Don't be fooled by the number of sailors signed up for the events. The actual number going is ofter much higher.
Oakland Sailing Meetup Group (OSMG) welcomes all (and kids can go, half price or free when adult attendance covers the minimum for renting the boat(s) we use).
We sail for the fun and love of sailing and to just practice. Our fun/practice outings include: sunset sails, casual sailing, Bay cruises, loops around an island, sail to SF city front. Try a sail to an island raft-up or a photography sailing tour of San Francisco Bay. We often enjoy great foody pot-luck BBQs either at Afterguard's site or on a raft-up of boats.
Want to GO SAILING - It is easy to get aboard a boat with OSMG - there are lots of boats. Our primary sponsor is a professional sailing school with a foundation arm that links to the Sea Scouts, Vets and many ages of kids plus Meetup. This is why our Meetup has access to many boats. We do pay to use the boats, but way less than the cost for privately owned yachts placed in charter.
Event cuts offs are set as close to the sailing event as possible. If at the last minute. turns out you can go - just call the posted numbers. Won't check email if close to ""cast off"" point. You don't want to miss the boat.
Members: If you have an idea for a sail or group event - email it in. This is your group too.
April-October 6-8:30 pm we sail every Wed. Some years we host wine or beer tasting and foodie events to follow sailing. In Nov-Mar is when there are more raft ups on weekends and other kinds of sails that follow with the many holidays.
Want to learn to sail? We meet at Afterguard Sailing Academy - the Bay Area's most affordable professional sailing school - the little school with heart. As a school Afterguard does specialize in setting up classes for friends, couples and families on the same boat. Sounds like 'Dah' yet many professional schools force families or couple to separate to different boats to learn. Sailing for Afterguard is a shared sport - learning how to share sailing, as a family, friend, couples, family or co-workers can help to get things done. Afterguard enjoys the reputation as the school that provides the best sailing education for your money. See the sponsor tab to learn more about Afterguard.
Oakland Sailing Meetup Group started in 2008. We are still sailing and loving it."

Some suggested meetups might be: local concerts/events/fairs, new restaurant openings, happy hours, children's events, walks, crafting, photo walks, geocaching, bowling, karaoke, biking, movie night, beer/wine tasting, dinner parties, holiday parties, picnics, etc. What do YOU like to do?

If you have any questions, concerns, comments or suggestions or just want to talk with me, give me a call or text at 707-567-8779. 
Again, welcome to the Vallejo/Benicia area and to our group!
Sincerely, Scott and the Vallejo/Benicia Area Newcomers Organizers (VBAN) and Hosts
P.S.
Membership dues are just $5 per year, to cover the fees that Meetup charges us, as well as any additional expenses such as fliers, signs, etc. If you have any trouble with paying online through Meetup, please contact me to arrange an alternate method. The dues for now are voluntary but I hope you'd like to contribute as the cost to meetup.com is almost $200 per year for the organizer and if there is some extra (there hasn't been as of yet) we'd like to put that toward events for those in need or those without perhaps, or maybe advertising or party accessories or games perhaps for the group events/activities. 
If you want to suggest/host a meetup, please follow these guidelines:
- You must be an ACTIVE member, and have attended at least TWO events where at least one of the regular VBAN organizers also attended, and we've had a chance to get to know you. This is to ensure everyone's continued FUN and SAFETY! As a general rule, it is not a good idea to email people from the group without their permission, and especially don't make others uncomfortable. Please share your real name (first only is ok) and share a picture of you (not just your animals or a sunset for example) in your profile so we can all have a deeper level of safety. Thank you for your understanding!
- If your suggested event is approved (usually they are!), it will be announced as an official meetup and the rest of the group will automatically be notified. Usually the only reason it would not be approved is if we don't know you yet, or the event conflicts with another proposed event. Again, thank you for your understanding!
- This particular group has a lot of people who are new to the area, and quite often are new to the whole ""meetup"" concept itself. So, in your meetup description, state clearly, where and when you will meet, how long you will be in the meeting spot, and how they can find you. Try to think of questions a new person might have, and include that information in your description.
If you do not wish to host the event, and you are just letting people know about something interesting that is happening, include ""No-host event"" in the title.
- If you ARE hosting an event, please bring a ""meetup"" sign with you that is large enough to be seen clearly, and display it or hold it so that new members can find you easily. You can ""google"" the word ""meetup"" and print out the logo. Usually a half-sheet of cardstock, with the logo printed on the bottom half is good. You can then fold it in half and it will stand up by itself on a table.
See you soon!

SF Bay Sailing Meetup Group,1,"A place for Skippers and Crew to ""Meetup"" and share a safe, enjoyable day on the water while practicing sailing skills and learning more about boats, sailing and the sea.
And, of course, we are the newest, classiest and best looking sailing meetup group in the Bay Area. ;-)
If you have taken a small boat sailing or basic keel-boat class and would like to get some experience actually working a sailboat on the Bay, then this Meetup group is for you. Don't be offended by being called a Newbie, sharing our love of sailing is what we enjoy most.
While it should not need to be said, please know that everyone is welcome here. Being chosen for an event is completely based on order of sign-up and confirmation. 
When you sign up for an event, you must be serious about attending. You may not sign up as ""something that you might like to do"" and then decide at the last minute that you would rather do something else. With other Meetup groups this might be totally acceptable. But here if you take a spot, that someone else would have gladly filled, and don't show up, you have deprived someone else of the opportunity to enjoy a day on the Bay - so you will be removed from the group (even if you have paid for the event).
Oh, and if you act creepy, or make other members uncomfortable, you are out, period. No appeal. If you feel that someone is acting inappropriately, please let me (or Meetup) know.
Yes, we charge for most events. If you think that we make a profit, you are bad at math. The small donations towards expenses that you make do not come close to paying the substantial costs involves in operating and maintaining the boats, but they certainly help and they make doing what we do possible. If you bail on an event at the last minute please do not expect a refund, unless we are able to fill your seat.
Always answer the contact information questions when you sign up or you will not be considered and we cannot confirm your reservation.
Lastly, please keep coming back to the site to check and see if you have been selected to attend. If you have been selected you will receive further information on who, what, when and where. But if you have not been selected, you will not be contacted at all. It would be great if we could do this, but it is everything that we can do just to organize the event and keep the attendees informed. Thank you for your understanding on this one.
Notice: Please be aware that while the State of California may view possession of Marijuana as legal, the United States Government and the U.S. Coast Guard does not. You may not bring marijuana (or any other illegal drugs) onto our vessels. This is not debatable. 
Be assured that the Captains that participate in this Meetup Group are Licensed by the United States Coast Guard which involves extensive training and many years of experience. The boats are well maintained and equipped and we all carry commercial insurance. This is very different than all the other groups who do not have licensed Captains, nor the proper insurance (although many of these people do describe themselves as ""Captains""). If anyone asks you for money to attend a sailing event, ask to see their USCG Captain's license.
We put an emphasis on safety here, but we do want you to have an enjoyable time as well. So, please do understand that we will ask you to wear a life jacket (they are brand new and comfortable), but do come ready to have a great time. Thank you. 
Let's go sailing and have some fun."

Our meetings usually last about 30 minutes to an hour, but the meeting can go longer for those members who continue to hang out and just talk. We also host events that have nothing to do with books at all! Movies, lunch, theater! We hope that members can build some really great friendships through the group so we try and do a non-book related event every month. To get a better idea of what we're about, please take a moment to read the About Us page (located in the ""Pages"" tab), where you will find more information about how the group operates, a list of books that we have read, and a list of other fun events that we have done.
***Disclaimer*** The Roseville Women's Book Club is a casual, informal book club. I usually do not bring discussion questions to the meetings, but members are welcome to bring them if they like. Our meetings are a mixture of discussing the book and socializing with one another. Some discussions/meetings last longer than others and are always intermixed with off topic, social conversation. If you are seeking a more formal book club, with lengthy, in depth, serious discussions, this may not be the book club for you. If you're looking for a book club that is less intimidating and more casual in discussion, then we may be the perfect fit. If you're not sure, please join and try us out.

ii) If you have RSVPed 'YES' for an event have 3 'No Shows' in a 365 day period, you will be removed from the group. Changing the RSVP from YES to NO in last 4 hour period of the event will be considered 'No Show'.
If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to come, do not hesitate to let the organizers/event host know.
iv) We do understand your privacy concerns but do try to post a legitimate picture on your profile, especially if you are hosting an event. This helps other members to recognize you.
v) New applicants who do not have profile description or photo would not be accepted to the group, it is difficult to know if you are joining this group for legitimate reasons without that information.
vi) Lastly but most importantly:
If you are organizing an event through some other sources please do not make it an event on this meetup. This meetup is only for organizing events that you want to attend with members of this group. No promotional event please. Those events will be removed.

Sisters In Arms - Single Moms,1,"Are you a single mom or pregnant and single?
Join us as we share the joys and struggles of single motherhood!
Single moms have to do it all -- we have to be both the mother AND the father, the nurturer and disciplinarian, teacher, friend and provider. Sometimes, it's hard not to look around at the couples with or without kids and feel like no one understands what you are going through.
Sisters In Arms - Single Moms is a social/support networking community for ""solo moms"" to meet and form close connections with other moms in similar situations. This group encourages social and professional networking, and the sharing/exchange of ideas, tips and experiences with others who understand (and may actually be experiencing many of the same issues as you) in a compassionate, empowering atmosphere. Through our meetups, informal gatherings and friendly discussions, we address ALL topics pertaining to single motherhood (such as child support, raising children of all ages, first-time moms, pregnancy, dating/intimacy and co-parenting with exes, to name a few) -- no topic is EVER taboo! We pride ourselves on the fact that our community is full of supportive, non-judgmental ""Sisters"" who are there for you when you need someone to vent your frustrations to...
As Sisters In Arms, our main goal is to support one another and share in the laughter and fun that may have fallen to the wayside while we were focusing on being ""Super Mom."" We encourage those who may be feeling alone on their journey to attend one of our meetups -- we guarantee that you will walk away from the event with some new found friends!
We have several meetups* and outings scheduled each month, so please check our site/calendar regularly for event details. Although we are primarily based in the South Bay, we do try to schedule meetups all around the Bay Area, to accommodate the locational diversity of our community.
If you are interested in joining our group, please read our ""About Us"" page to learn more, and to familiarize yourself with our group policies.
*The majority of our meetups are child and ""framily"" (female friends or family) members friendly. Designated ""Moms Only"" events are open to Sisters and any female friends or family members, and ""Moms & Friends"" events are open to Sisters and male or female friends and family members.

!The Good Life!............... for people 30ish to 50ish,1,"We are a social group of people, mostly 30ish to 50ish, who want to, and realize, we live The Good Life!
Most events are social in nature. We are open to singles, couples, and in between. We will do activities such as mingling over wine or cocktails and are focused on making friends, or things like dancing, hikes, movies, concerts, lunches, picnics, street fairs, community service projects, workshops, etc. We want to attract people with good social skills that are fun and friendly, young at heart, active, easy going, and adventurous for events in the South Bay, Peninsula, and Greater Bay Area.   So, if you want to live The Good Life, make more friends, and do fun activities, come join us!!!   In trying to keep it fun and friendly, as organizer, I'm very protective of the overall group atmosphere. So, here's a short list of people that should skip our group.  1. Creepy men that are too touchy with women they have just met.  2. People who don't get the concept of friends, and instead are stalkers, players or drama queens.  3. Party crashers, who crash closed RSVP parties making it too crowded.  4. People not interested in friendships, who join just to send spam about their book, band, Amway, etc.   All these people get deleted from the group fast."

Milpitas Social Group (MSG),1,"First and foremost, we wanted to create a place where everyone in the Bay Area can meet and make new friends doing something fun.   
This group is for all ages over 18!!!
WHAT WE DO? We do things around the Bay Area (from San Francisco to Santa Barbara):

We eat: dinners, pot lucks, happy hours, parties with food
We have fun: zip lines, paddle boats, beach parties, camping, treat yourself to a massage/spa treatment, holiday parties, monopoly board games, social dances
We get fit: hiking, walking, dancing
We improve our relationship potentials: dating games, meeting new people, practicing our flirting skills, figuring out what we want in potential mates, learning how to attract the right people

We want this group to be a positive and safe place where you can explore your interests and potentials with confidence. For this reason, we are selective. We are only looking for people of high quality: people who are respectful and courteous of others, people who are committed to learning and growing, people who are open-minded and friendly (afterall, socializing means getting along with others, among other things.)
IS THIS GROUP RIGHT FOR ME?
The answer is yes, if you are:

Just broke up with a boyfriend/girlfriend? Well join the group! Struggling with Divorce? Meet other people who are also in the midst of divorce, custody, or support-related issues and need some direction.
Tired of the online dating scenes where you soon realized that eternal texting, chatting, and emailing cannot compare to a real human experience where you actually spend time doing something with someone? Well, we have live and real-time interacting here!
Newly singled and are yet unsure what you want to do with your life? We suggest an experimental period of staying single where you can try a variety of new things, make new friends, gain new attitudes etc... You just need to find what is really right for YOU!
Interested in making yourself attractive to potential mates? Your first mission should be to figure out what makes you happy as a single person and learning to enjoy life to its fullest extent while making plenty of friends out there on the trails, at the dinner parties or our other fun events.
Wanting to get out of a rut? If you picture yourself as always being alone, miserable or whatever then your subconscious will see to it that you do things to keep you that way. BUT, if you can visualize yourself as having fun, being with other people and happier, then your subconscious will work to make positive things happen helping to boost your confidence, increase your potential, and making you the fun, interesting and attractive person that you were meant to be.

Remember, ""because you are alive, everything is possible!""
Thich Nhat Hanh
DO IT NOW! By signing up, you are telling yourself that there is absolutely no need to be miserable. As most people spend more time planning a weekend than they do planning the rest of their life, you can go against the norm and plan for the rest of your life by spending your weekends with us!

Peninsula Dames Read-n-Eat Book Club,1,"Good books and good food go hand in hand, I think! A not-taken-too-seriously sort of women's book group that also shuns your everyday ""chicklit"" - not because some aren't romping good reads but they don't exactly warrant full discussion.
Meetings take place at a restaurant or establishment so we can all try new places. Also, if you don't quite get around to finishing the book (or reading it for that matter...no worries!).  Just feel free to come to the meetings and socialize too.  Quarterly, we may meet at a members house for a potluck meet up to enjoy new recipes!"

Over the past year or so, Midtown Readers has grown into a social group that meets three times a month to discuss books (Midtown Readers), watch documentaries (Documentary Night), and make stuff (Midtown Makers). Some of us also meet as part of the Women's March movement (

Social Fluency,1,"My name is Barbara Hyman, and I'm an author, teacher, and healer. I've been on the Spiritual Path for awhile, by virtue of my advanced age. (Pushing 60!). That makes me sound a lot older than I feel. 
I feel young because every day I connect with my Spiritual path, and my love, which is the energetic frequency and vibration of communication and manifestation. 
This is what I teach about, and what my upcoming book, Deliberate Trust, A Guide to Intentional Manifestation is all about. 
So, when you're speaking about communication, in my book, you're speaking about love. 
And when you're speaking about improving communication, in my book, you're speaking about personal growth, and spiritual evolution. 
So, I hope we can meet, and make a difference in eachothers' lives!
Thanks for your interest and participation in this powerful conversation about living in harmony with other Human Beings. "

30's to 40's Santa Cruz Girlfriends' Club,1," I've lived in Santa Cruz off and on for over seven years as a thirty something and now a forty something, and found that it can be rather challenging to meet other ladies of the same age who like to get out and have some fun! This group is to provide a safe, comfortable space for like minded women to get together and chat, laugh, bond, and just be girls-- while possibly discovering a new restaurant, cafe, wine bar, beach, or local fun event that you didn't even know existed!  We have also had numerous, very successful game-nights!  I also strongly encourage all of our members to suggest new meetups -- your fresh ideas and energy are what will keep this group alive and intereresting!  In order to join the group you need to have an actual picture of yourself on your meetup profile, so that we'll know who to look for at our events.  As a friendly reminder this group is NOT for networking, selling, or info gathering--only for women who are sincerely interested in making some new friends.  "

Ultimate Football Walnut Creek (UFWC),1,"We've been playing UF since November 1st, 2009 and recently completed our 500th game.  UF is a team oriented, competitive and fast paced game for adults and older kids. We play most weekends and occasional evening games mid-week. Games are capped at 26 players.  Occasionally, we run a tournaments.
 UF is not a league; there is no commitment to play.  If you decide to play, you simply confirm when you can and then show up.  It's a great workout and a fun time with friends. Sportsmanship, teamwork and fair play are the most critical components of UF and a must for anyone who decides to compete.  We have a code of conduct and we're serious about it. 
For night games, we charge $5 to cover the fees for the lights and any additional money goes to our charitable efforts.  Once a month, we'll have a GRATEFUL GAME where players are asked to contribut $5 each for charity.
 In 2014, we raised just over $7,100 to help the Lazarex Cancer Foundation (www.lazarex.org).  That money was raised through optional player donations.  In 2015, we raised $2,500 and provided 112 ($5,000) worth of microloans across the world through www.kiva.org.  In 2016, we donated $2,750 to the City of Hope, $3,000 to Heifer International (6 cows), $875 to a local science teacher, $875 to Contra Costa Group Homes and $875 to Groceries for Seniors in San Francisco.  In 2017 we have devoted over $4,300 to one of our own struggling with a serious illness.  In 2018.....
To learn more and get on our invite list, e-mail, call or text Aaron Davis at adavis35@hotmail.com or 925.323.9409.
 How we play:
 1.  If you don't know how to play, we'll teach you.  Everyone is welcome!
2.  Good sportsmanship, safety and respect for the game rules is absolutely non-negotiable.  Ultimate Football is meant to be be fun and competitive for all players.
 3.  We start and end each game as friends and we treat eachother with respect.  We help eachother on the field and we keep the comments positive and we involve everyone in the game.
 4.  We show up on time, ready to play and we keep our status updated if our plans have change.
 5.  Hope to see you on the field.  Ultimate is great fun and exercise!"
Sacramento Sea Kayakers,1,"Who We Are & What We Do:
Sacramento Sea Kayakers is a non-profit organization that is organized collectively by its members. Members range from beginners to professionals, and own all types of paddling craft. We paddle all types of bodies of water including lakes, rivers, bays, and ocean. Recreational kayaks and entry level skills are sufficient for many of the club's events, but some events necessitate specific skills and equipment. Our paddles offer lots of fun practice opportunities for ""new to paddling"" and intermediate flat water paddlers. Motivated kayakers will find ample opportunities to ramp up their skills through our skill clinics and advanced paddles, which when combined with some formal training, and lots of fun practice will help paddlers transition into being comfortable on the bay and ocean.
All dues and fees received are used to pay for things as determined by the Members, such as free or reduced camping, meals, skills clinics, classes and parties, etc. We avoid commercial or political interests, but to enhance the sport of kayaking we do make some exceptions.
Mission Statement:
Sacramento Sea Kayakers Paddling Club (SSKPC / SSK) promotes kayaking in a safe and responsible manner, while making new friendships with a common interest. We kayak year round and encourage paddlers to expand their skills through training with professional 
Monthly Public Meetings:
The club has Monthly Educational Meetings that are open to the public. These usually occur the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 6p.m. at a location posted on the Meet-up site. These meetings provide great opportunities for paddlers (club members and the public alike) to socialize and learn more about kayaking. These meetings are also a great way for new and prospective members to learn about the club and meet other members.
Joining Sacramento Sea Kayakers:
Membership Requirements
Membership is open to anyone.  We have no secret hand shakes or initiation protocols but to participate in our paddles, membership is required, and becoming a member is pretty easy to do.  When you click the ""Join Us!"" button to join our group, PLEASE enter your FIRST NAME and the initial letter of your LAST NAME. We are real people, who do real things, and have real friendships, so we use our real names.  We also want to be able to recognize you, and you us, so our second basic requirement for membership is a recognizable picture of you. 
Third, when you join us on a paddle all paddlers fill out an emergancy contact and waiver form. A PAYPAL ACCOUNT IS NOT REQUIRED, YOU MAY PAY WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD.
We do not have a family rate, or provide refunds.
Event Organizers / Trip Initiators Are Not Guides:  
Although Meetup uses the term ""Event Organizer"", Sacramento Sea Kayakers prefers the term ""Trip Initiator"".  Sacramento Sea Kayakers does cooperative, non-guided, trips. Trip initiators are no more responsible for the safety of others than anyone else in the group.  If you need or desire a guide, hire a professional through a commercial outfitter.
Each and every meetup participant is responsible for his/her own safety.  Use your own judgement.  Never blindly follow anyone into a situation you are unsure about.
On trips be prepared to take care of yourself.  This does not mean that the other members of the group won't assist anyone who needs it, but such assistance should never be taken for granted, especially in difficult conditions. Be aware that, despite all good intentions, there is always a real possibility of being separated from the group.  It is up to each and every participant to know the trip agenda.  Approach each trip as if you were initiating and planning it yourself.  Trip initiators are members of the club just like everyone else.  Some may have more experience than you, while others may not.  They are not professionals; don't be over-reliant on them.
Although trip initiators are not responsible for evaluating participants' kayaking abilities, they  have the right to eliminate anyone who they feel is not prepared with the adequate skills or equipment for a particular trip.  Trip initiators can organize (or not organize) the trip any way he or she wants. Get to know your trip initiator(s) and feel free to talk to him/her beforehand to find out how the trip is to be structured.
Becoming an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator
Any MEMBER who follows SSK Trip Initiator Guidelines (which are contained within the below form) is eligible to be an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator.  If you would like to plan and post trips for our club, you are encouraged to complete the "

"I am happy project - Napa, CA",1,"Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances. According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego: “When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person’s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.” Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity. If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

East Bay Ladies 30s/20s Book Club,1,"Back by popular demand... First, thanks for taking the first step in joining a special group of ladies who love to read, chat, over enjoy a glass of wine. This group was initially started quite a few years ago because our fearless leader is a book junkie who was looking to join a book club in the area and found none. After a year on Facebook, She decided it was time to take the group back where it all started. We read mostly contemporary lit, but do mix it up every so often with a classic. This is the book club for anyone who has read/watched ""The Jane Austin Book Club"" and thought it would be great to connect and share my thoughts with fellow readers. If you want to be more than an attendee and build relationships with other women this is the club for you. We do try and host social events monthly. Believe it or not we love e-mail, so please reach out to us if you have any questions."

If you're interested in joining our group please send a request. 
We have a few important things for you to be aware of.  Please read before joining:
Membership dues are a very low $6/year.  This helps cover meetup costs and helps promote more invloved members.
We require that you have a current picture of yourself as well as your first name in your profile.   This makes everyone more comfortable with meeting new people and makes it easier for us to find/recognize first timers.
This group can only be successful with active members.  We want it to be a venue for making new and, hopefully, lasting friendships.  That can only happen with members who participate in our events.  Any member who has not been active with the group for 6 months may be removed, regardless of paid dues. You are always welcome to rejoin if you are able to participate and will only have to repay dues when they come due again.
Our organizers work hard to plan events, which often requires making reservations based on the number of people attending.  Your RSVP is a firm commitment that you will be attending an event.  We know life happens and plans change.  If that happens, please be courteous and change your RSVP or communicate directly with the event host as soon as possible.  If you are unsure whether or not you will be able to attend an event, please hold off on RSVP'ing until you are more certain.  3 no shows and/or last minute cancellations, without communicating with the organizer, will result in removal from the group.  Membership dues will not be refunded if this occurs.   
We don't hold many events in personal residences, but it does happen on occasion.  We require that you attend at least 2 public-place events before attending one that is being held at someone's home. 
There are lots of fun things planned and we all look forward to meeting you.  Let's connect and have fun while creating memories and lasting friendships."

Awaken The Goddess Within And Transform Your Health,1,"The purpose of this group is to have a circle of women who are passionate about getting stronger, healthier, and awakening the inner Goddess that is inside each and every one of us. 
The organizer of this Meetup is Jen Seregos. She has been in the health industry for over 10 years in the fitness and nutrition space. In 2011, she found out she had a genetic mutation that made her susceptible to cancer and had to have her breasts surgically removed to prevent cancer. Shortly after that, her husband left her and a within 2 years of that, her mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and lost her battle in 2014. 
Jen had hit rock bottom and through this process of loss, grief, and failure, she realized that there was more to being ""healthy"" than just exercise and eating right. She began to incorporate what she needed in order to have a healthy mental, emotional, and spiritual state as well. 
When she discovered the formula to have a complete, holistic, and integrated approach to health, she regained her confidence and her inner Goddess.
Now, her passion is sharing this process with her fellow women!
Join us as we reclaim our power together, get healthy, strong, and ready to take on the world.

And sometimes we just have fun!"
"Women Who Dine, Drink, and Curse",1,"If you're a woman who is interested in making new friends and you have a relaxed attitude, join us! The plan is to have frequent and varied events so there is always something on the agenda. Dinners, brunch, scenic walks, festivals, happy hour--we'll try to find interesting and fun things to do.
I hate to start out with a rules list but in attending other meet-ups, I think it's important to set expectations. The best Meet Up group I was involved in only allowed 100 members and kept a waitlist of prospects. The administrator set up basic rules at the very beginning. Long lasting friendships resulted from that group and I'd love to see the same thing here. 
So, these are the ""rules""
1. If you sign up and are inactive for 2 months, you're automatically removed. If you're going out of town or will be inactive but want to remain involved, just shoot us an email and we'll keep you active.
2. If you RSVP and then are a no show twice, you're removed. 
3. We'll cap the group at 100. Please, if you join, look around and decide this isn't for you, leave the group so there's room for someone else. 
4. The yearly fee for membership is $5.00. It costs $15 per month to keep the group active. Once that is paid for, the remaining fees will be used however the group sees fit--a party or perhaps a holiday donation to a charity. Meet Up no longer allows us to accept fees through the group so we request that you either pay $5 at your first meet up or use PayPal.
5. You are welcome to attend the first event on us, if you want to continue, please pay the fee. If you attend an event and then we don't hear from you, we'll remove you so someone else can join.
6. We won't accept members who don't have a photo of themselves in their bio. We want to be able to recognize you at meet ups. It also cuts down on people who spam huge numbers of groups.
7. We won't accept members who do not live in the area. 
8. We won't accept members who don't have a personal profile picture. We want to be able to recognize you at events and to know you are a real person.
Finally, if you are interested in organizing events and setting up meet-ups, please let us know. It is really helpful to have several active organizers putting in events. It's also a great opportunity to find people who like to do the things you like to do! 
Input is appreciated. If you have suggestions for the group, we want to hear them so don't be shy.
Thank you."

Conscious Uncoupling Group Support for Divorce and Breakups,1,"Are you feeling hurt, sad and alone - perhaps even emotionally distraught - over a divorce or breakup? Dealing with an ex who refuses to acknowledge their actions, or to step up and handle your separation with kindness and consciousness? Are you doing your best to surf waves of grief and sadness? Or perhaps even like you were hit by a truck and confused about what happened? 
Are you feeling a lack of resolution or clarity? Wondering how you can avoid going through something like this again? Or perhaps even hopeless about having another relationship? 
If any of these apply to you, there is hope. It doesn't matter if your divorce or breakup was a few weeks ago or a few years ago; getting the right kind of support and doing some self-reflection is not just critical to your own healing, but also the doorway to even better relationships with a future partner, your friends and family and - perhaps most of all - yourself.
I became a Conscious Uncoupling coach after I went through my own devastating break up. I felt all of these things.... hit by a truck!  Devastated!! Confused!  And my ex refused to even explain to me what was happening or why. It has taken time and work - showing up - but I know I am a better person / friend / family member for it, and I will make a much better partner in the future. I feel empowered and hopeful, and you will, too.
This group will offer:
1. informational sessions about Conscious Uncoupling: what it is, how to do it, and how to decide whether to do it on your own or with a coach.
2. Group coaching in a confidential and deeply loving and supportive group.
3. One-day workshops that will be nurturing, informative, eye-opening and healing.
I look forward to meeting you at an event. Events will be held in both Folsom and Placerville.

Share your story, empower yourself, and in turn, empower each other."
Bay Area Indian Divorce Support & Recovery Group (IDSRG),1,"Few years ago, I had started Bay Area Indian Single Parents & Divorcees group, the group was community partners with India Community Center (ICC). The goal was to help support, educate, survive, recover from the life changing events and help people find a life partner in the process. I found my love, or at least thought so, got remarried, reasons which I got out of the group and let friends manage it. The old group is still alive under a different name, but lost it's mission, it's original charter and become a party place. Plus unfortunate it is, that I find myself in family court, seeking Nullity and looking for support again. Not finding any, starting this new group for divorce support and recovery.
You can join this group if you are of Indian origin, living in bay area and going through divorce or divorced looking for support. I'll allow middle-aged never married singles in the group, it there intent is to find life partner and settle down. If you are trying to save your marriage, please try hard, especially if you have kids. The grass always looks green on other side, but it never is!
Note, this group is not a party group or a pickup joint. Dating is not the goal, but if long term relationships and remarriages happen between group members, we all will be happy and wish them well.
This a community effort and I would like all members to participate. We can be friends, provide support 1-1 or have discussions in group setting. We could have attorneys, educators, mediators, counselors, therapists and parenting experts come give talks to group members. Is there is enough interest, I will look to partner with ICC again. I'm a First Year Law School student myself and would be willing to help (pro-bono) anyone who reaches out to me, limited by my knowledge and experience. Please do note that I am not an attorney as yet, so anything I say or do is friendly help and any action you take based on discussions in this group is at your own risk. You should always get your legal advice from your attorney.
All members are recommended to maintain clear photo on their profile, use complete/real name and answer all profile question honestly. I understand its not always feasible to have profile photo and real name while going through divorce, in that case, please you must send me a private message with real identity.
Everything discussed in the group will be confidential and all members will treat fellow members with respect, be sensitive to their issues.
This is a group for good people who find themselves in an unfortunate situation, need support and want to live though difficult times."

Please note that we strive to maintain a ""drama"" free environment.  
We are always looking for help, so email the leadership team if you are interested in hosting events.  Due to size and liability issues we do not permit members to bring guests to events held in private homes or to events limited in number.

*Members often would like to share rides to events.  It is up to the person(s) looking for a ride to obtain one. We are unable to offer carpools to our members due to liability issues.  When securing a ride with another member, it is the rider's responsibility to require adequate car insurance, safety of vehicle, and competence of driver.

Those who get moved to the waitlist the morning of an event and back out will also be charged a ""no show."" Those with 5 late bail outs will be removed from the group.  We have a firm 10 minute wait rule for events. Those who RSVP and are late may be left behind. It is your responsibility to take care and manage your own RSVPs - including your place on a wait list.  This means changing your RSVP to ""no"" when you are unable to attend an event so that those on the wait list are able to move up.

*This group does not support promotion of any kind, including:  marketing, products, or people. Any postings or actions of this type will be removed along with the person who posted it.  
*We love our pets - at home!  Due to allergies and liability issues, please do not bring pets to events.  Please know that many of our members who host events in their homes do have pets. It is your responsibility to inquire if you have issues with pets.

Are you ready to become a public speaker? 
Do you know that speaking is the #1 way you can get clients when you have your own business?
Speaking is something that every entrepreneur should be focusing more on: 
- how to do it
- what to speak about
- how to incorporate it into your business
- how to get leads from speaking
- how to sell from stage or how to sell from a webinar
But the problem is that very few entrepreneurs actually do this. OR they do it but don't really understand how it can correlate to sales in their business. 
Speaking is something that you want to get some training with on:
- how to create your talks and presentations
- how to own the stage
- how to create a speaker sheet
- how to get speaking gigs and opportunities
- how to present yourself during the speaking gig
- how to gather leads during speaking gigs 
- in person or virtually
- how to sell from stage 
- how to follow up effectively (most of your sales will come in the follow up!) 
- how to present yourself as a speaker on your website and online social profiles
- and soooo much more!
The webinar here is a snippet of what we do at the Sacramento Speaker & Entrepreneur Network meetings and online webinars. We have a community on Meetup and Facebook that anyone can join to learn more about speaking to grow your business, entrepreneurship, business and marketing.

San Mateo Business Masters,1,"The San Mateo Business Masters group is first and foremost a free entrepreneur networking group for solo-preneurs and owner-operated businesses of all sizes. Whether you are a business veteran or a new entrepreneur, our networking events provide for a safe and secure environment to all. In fact, the diversity in members brings added benefits to us all.
We meet once a week for a breakfast mixer and to discuss and learn about local business and entrepreneurship issues. The meetings start promptly with the mixer portion (networking) of the event. Then, while we eat breakfast we invite the speaker of the week to enlighten us about different aspect of business management. Each week the topics and the speakers are different. Then after the meeting, members who desire can stick around or set appointments to get to know each other better.Members of the group with relevant topics will be invited to speak in front of the group and share their expertise if they desire to.
In this challenging economy it is important to have a group of peers and business associates to count on. Yet, most networking groups, like BNI's and BRN's are nothing more than a place to pass business cards around.
Business Masters is different. We understand that solid and long term business relationships are not forged by handing business cards to strangers, but rather by connecting with people and making friends. Like a member previously stated: ""Nobody cares to do business with business cards, but we all care about people!""
Unlike many other networking groups that charge you hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year, Business Masters is 100% no charge. Obviously you have to buy your own food, but that's it. We know that by not charging a membership fee more people are inclined to attend. The more people who attend the more relationship bonds are created. That's how economies are created!
We are all looking forward to meeting you at next week's event."

I'm always down to do anything!
