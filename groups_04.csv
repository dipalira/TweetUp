However, the media, including public radio and television, do not encourage any scrutiny even though it is their job to do so. Why do they not want to engage in this conversation? It is a question we ask and wonder why so many citizens are unfamiliar with the third World Trade Center to collapse on September 11?

While we sometimes discuss local political and social issues that are of interest to our members, we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the free market. Our get-togethers are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.</p>

This will require us to develop an understanding of the various ideologies which have made both Freedom-Fighters and Tyrants tick; and the means by which they enlightened and inspired or deluded and intimidated critical segments of the populous and thus shifted the course of history in the direction of a free, voluntary social order or a hegemonic order of masters and slaves. Come get acquainted, enjoy a beer or coffee while listening to a short discourse on a predefined topic, then engage in creative argumentation, chaotic discussion, provocative insinuation, or just do what thou wilt and let that be the whole of the law.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/e/7/highres_438677639.jpeg","438677639","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/e/7/600_438677639.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/e/7/thumb_438677639.jpeg","event","18663494","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/0/f/highres_446871983.jpeg","446871983","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/0/f/600_446871983.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/0/f/thumb_446871983.jpeg","event","44.77","https://www.meetup.com/freeradicals/","USA","Burnsville, MN","-93.28","143","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Free Radicals - Theory and History of Freedom","","","","","","","157405922","Elliot","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/e/6/b/highres_247192843.jpeg","247192843","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/e/6/b/member_247192843.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/e/6/b/thumb_247192843.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","MN","active","US/Central","freeradicals","public","Free Radicals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

You decide what level of interest and commitment you will bring to the group. You can just socialize with people who share your values, or get more involved. Whether it be writing letters, calling Members of Congress, marching to the capitol, joining town halls (even empty chair events!) or just sharing a festive dinner with like minded friends, we create opportunities for progressives to meet, socialize and participate. PALLS organizes educational events and posts actions from other groups of interest to our members. We meet for coffee periodically and host Sunday brunches the third Sunday of each month. <br></p>
<p>If you want to organize an event or cross list progressive activities, we will help you. We welcome and encourage new members to bring their ideas for events and activities to our group. Democracy takes work and it is involves all of us working together. Host a coffee chat. Organize an discussion group. Invite activists to tell us about their work. Plan a happy hour or an informal lunch or dinner.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

The title of our group, The Green Anchor, was the name of the restaurant in Vienna where Ludwig von Mises gathered with his friends to discuss economics well into the late evening.</span> If you are not familiar with Austrian Economics or Ludwig von Mises, you can get a quick overview here (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises</a>) and here (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_school"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_school</a>). Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

The title of our group, The Green Anchor, was the name of the restaurant in Vienna where Ludwig von Mises gathered with his friends to discuss economics well into the late evening.</span> If you are not familiar with Austrian Economics or Ludwig von Mises, you can get a quick overview here (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises</a>) and here (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_school"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_school</a>). Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute (<a href=""http://mises.org/"">http://mises.org/</a>), which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>While we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the market, we also discuss practical issues revolving around individual and small group ""economizing"" in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
<p>Our meetups are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs.

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>
<p>Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI</a> , and the related videos on that YouTube page.</p>
<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs. This is a ""Learnfest!""

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>At: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CrlDr-IEAA"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CrlDr-IEAA</a> &nbsp;she begs the media to do their job.</p>
<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>
<p>Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI</a> , and the related videos on that YouTube page.</p>
<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts.

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>

<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate. Go to: <a href=""http://debategraph.org/Stream.aspx?nid=218999&amp;iv=05"">http://debategraph.or...</a> and click on the tiny ""Debategraph"" tab on the bottom left to begin to use this new tool. <br> <br><br> <span><strong>Please be sure to enable the site to send you emails.</strong></span> <br> <br> Contact: <br> Donald Stahl <br> politicstahl@hotmail.com.</p>

<p>For U.S. citizens, think of the shackles removed, the freedom to travel freely and buy property in Mexico, were it is warm in the winter, the ease of vacation travel there.&nbsp; For potential Mexican state U.S. citizens think of the right to participate fully in the best democracy on the planet, bar none; better law, education, medicine, highways, infrastructure, security.&nbsp; And for Mexicans and Americans alike the disintegration of all the immigration hassles, less court cases on citizenship/green cards and more court cases on drug cartel mobsters. </p> 
<p>Less money spent in USA for walls, border patrols, ICE, drug interdiction (and by the way freedom to actively pursue drug cartels with a smaller border police contingent between Belize/Guatemala and the new Mexican state of USA.&nbsp; Consider: better medicine for Mexico; &nbsp;more tax dollars for USA, graduated federal and state taxing in 51st state over five years to build taxing infrastructure/administration. </p> 
<p>More natural resources for USA, hopefully with the intent to preserve the most resources we can and use as little as possible, wisely. More solar energy development, possibly wind farms where they meet criteria.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs. This is a ""Learnfest!"" So come test your views on politics, heaven and hell, the best positions for making love, affirmative action, etc...what you learn should and could be fun!</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/highres_2884004.jpeg","2884004","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/600_2884004.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/thumb_2884004.jpeg","event","911513","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/highres_2884004.jpeg","2884004","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/600_2884004.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/thumb_2884004.jpeg","event","38.63","https://www.meetup.com/politicalcafe-66/","USA","Saint Louis, MO","-90.19","2776","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","The Issues You Don't Talk About Cafe","cgqvkpyxhbrb","The Issues You Don't Talk About Cafe Mid-Month Meetup","1526248800000","-18000000","6","One of the fondest memories of my high school youth was drama class.

We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>At: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CrlDr-IEAA"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CrlDr-IEAA</a> &nbsp;she begs the media to do their job.</p>
<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>
<p>Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI</a> , and the related videos on that YouTube page.</p>
<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs.

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>
<p>Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI</a> , and the related videos on that YouTube page.</p>
<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs. This is a ""Learnfest!"" So come test your views on politics, heaven and hell, the best positions for making love, affirmative action, etc...what you learn should and could be fun!</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/highres_2884004.jpeg","2884004","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/600_2884004.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/thumb_2884004.jpeg","event","911513","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/highres_2884004.jpeg","2884004","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/600_2884004.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/thumb_2884004.jpeg","event","38.63","https://www.meetup.com/politicalcafe-66/","USA","Saint Louis, MO","-90.19","2776","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","The Issues You Don't Talk About Cafe","cgqvkpyxhbrb","The Issues You Don't Talk About Cafe Mid-Month Meetup","1526248800000","-18000000","6","One of the fondest memories of my high school youth was drama class.

We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs.

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>
<p>Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI</a> , and the related videos on that YouTube page.</p>
<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs. This is a ""Learnfest!"" So come test your views on politics, heaven and hell, the best positions for making love, affirmative action, etc...what you learn should and could be fun!</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/highres_2884004.jpeg","2884004","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/600_2884004.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/thumb_2884004.jpeg","event","911513","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/highres_2884004.jpeg","2884004","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/600_2884004.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/4/thumb_2884004.jpeg","event","38.63","https://www.meetup.com/politicalcafe-66/","USA","Saint Louis, MO","-90.19","2776","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","The Issues You Don't Talk About Cafe","cgqvkpyxhbrb","The Issues You Don't Talk About Cafe Mid-Month Meetup","1526248800000","-18000000","6","One of the fondest memories of my high school youth was drama class.

We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive.

<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>

<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate. Go to: <a href=""http://debategraph.org/Stream.aspx?nid=218999&amp;iv=05"">http://debategraph.or...</a> and click on the tiny ""Debategraph"" tab on the bottom left to begin to use this new tool. <br> <br><br> <span><strong>Please be sure to enable the site to send you emails.</strong></span> <br> <br> Contact: <br> Donald Stahl <br> politicstahl@hotmail.com.</p>

This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Caution:</strong></span> If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we.</em> Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs.

<p>We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""</p>
<p><span>James Ridgeway says:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"". . . not one person in the White House</span></span><span><span>—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families.</span></span> <span><span>Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable.""</span></span> <span><span>(<em>The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11,</em> p. 88.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>And, several were handsomely rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:</span> <br> </span></span></span></p>
<p>""<em>Novaya Gazeta</em> editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""</p>
<p>Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY</strong></p>
<p>(If you have not read Ibsen's play <em>An Enemy of the People,</em> it is available here: <span><a href=""http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibsen/enemy-people.pdf"" class=""linkified"">http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/h-ibs...</a> &nbsp;.</span><span>)</span></p>
<p>We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry&nbsp;into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers."" &nbsp;Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video <em>9/11: Press for Truth</em>, at: <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3979568779414136481"" class=""linkified"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=397...</a> .</p>
<p>Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.</p>
<p>Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani &nbsp;has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:&nbsp;<a href=""http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://marianilawsuit.wordpress.com/</a> .</p>
<p>We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11. &nbsp;Her feelings may be seen at: <a href=""http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh-o-connor-speaks-out"" class=""linkified"">http://www.videorolls.com/watch/donna-marsh...</a>.</p>

<p>At: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CrlDr-IEAA"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CrlDr-IEAA</a> &nbsp;she begs the media to do their job.</p>
<p>While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OASbBr99heQ</a> .</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg"" class=""linkified"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SQJz-wnQg</a> .</p>
<p>Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwgZzeq8oI</a> , and the related videos on that YouTube page.</p>
<p>Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory"" &nbsp;by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vicwIrB9JFw</a> , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at&nbsp;<a href=""http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/"">http://consciouslifenews.com/psychologists-explain-911-denial-despite-hard-scientific-evidence/1122104/</a><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Popular writer Jonah Berger's book, <i>Invisible Influence</i>, begins&nbsp;its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;chapter, ""Monkey See, Monkey Do,"" by expounding the findings of Muzafer Sherif and Solomon&nbsp;Asch.</span></p>
<p><span>""To&nbsp;test whether&nbsp;people&nbsp;conformed because&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer was&nbsp;uncertain,&nbsp;Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when&nbsp;the answer was&nbsp;obvious. When people could easily tell&nbsp;the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .</span></p>
<p><span>""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave&nbsp;the wrong response. People should act independently&nbsp;and go with what they saw.&nbsp;</span><span>Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span>""They didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>""Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span>""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on&nbsp;every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect.""</span> <br></p>
<p>The&nbsp;video <em>9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</em>, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and&nbsp;is available at: <a href=""http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspira...</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama &amp; the Bin Ladens"" (wh<span>ic</span>h in my opinion is excellent) entitled,&nbsp;<span><em>It's All A Lie (Still You Believe)</em></span> at: &nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg"" class=""linkified"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKUs65beKg</a> .</p>
<p>At the website <a href=""http://9-11.meetup.com/"">http://9-11.meetup.com/</a> you will find a map indicating Meetup groups around the world covering the topic of 9/11. Note that these are only Meetup groups, and as such do not represent all the groups which are concerned with 9/11. There are no regulations pertaining to membership in Meetup groups, and anyone anywhere in the world is invited to join this group in order to participate in it to whatever extent is possible for them. Persons outside the U.S.A. may be able to provide valuable services not possible for those inside it. If nothing else, they can provide useful information pertaining to their locations.&nbsp;An international calendar of 9/11 events is at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.911truth.org/calendar.php"">http://www.911truth.o...</a></p>
<p>We meet occasionally at various locations.</p>
<p>The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""&nbsp; <br> <br> It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them. <br> <br> In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (<em>i.e</em>., everyone) to participate.

Our two parties are producing zero results for the American people, as they are more focused on running to the extremes to win elections than coming to center to solve problems. The political pendulum swings back and forth, but very little is getting done. It’s time to change the equation. The Centrist Project aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty. We are a 21st Century political organization dedicated to organizing Centrist voters and supporting independent candidates who desire to put our country ahead of any political faction in order to solve problems. We are organizing a grassroots movement of Americans –– Democrats, Republicans, and independents –– who feel left behind by both parties and who want our leaders to work together to get things done.

Our two parties are producing zero results for the American people, as they are more focused on running to the extremes to win elections than coming to center to solve problems. The political pendulum swings back and forth, but very little is getting done. It’s time to change the equation. The Centrist Project aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty. We are a 21st Century political organization dedicated to organizing Centrist voters and supporting independent candidates who desire to put our country ahead of any political faction in order to solve problems. We are organizing a grassroots movement of Americans –– Democrats, Republicans, and independents –– who feel left behind by both parties and who want our leaders to work together to get things done.

Our two parties are producing zero results for the American people, as they are more focused on running to the extremes to win elections than coming to center to solve problems. The political pendulum swings back and forth, but very little is getting done. It’s time to change the equation. The Centrist Project aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty. We are a 21st Century political organization dedicated to organizing Centrist voters and supporting independent candidates who desire to put our country ahead of any political faction in order to solve problems. We are organizing a grassroots movement of Americans –– Democrats, Republicans, and independents –– who feel left behind by both parties and who want our leaders to work together to get things done.

Our two parties are producing zero results for the American people, as they are more focused on running to the extremes to win elections than coming to center to solve problems. The political pendulum swings back and forth, but very little is getting done. It’s time to change the equation. The Centrist Project aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty. We are a 21st Century political organization dedicated to organizing Centrist voters and supporting independent candidates who desire to put our country ahead of any political faction in order to solve problems. We are organizing a grassroots movement of Americans –– Democrats, Republicans, and independents –– who feel left behind by both parties and who want our leaders to work together to get things done.

We are a group of conscientious volunteers who follow a Gandhian love based approach and hold peaceful vigils to bear witness of animals on their way to slaughter. With our campaigns of information, we make the public aware of the conditions in which animals used for food are raised, transported, and slaughtered. Our goals are to put “glass walls” on factory farms, live markets, and slaughterhouses in the Kansas City Area; and contribute to the public debate about the place of animals in our society.</p> 
<p>​We are an inclusive group that welcomes vegans and non-vegans alike. We educate people on the benefits of a vegan lifestyle, the unique and distinctive personalities of farmed animals (like those we recognize in companion animals) and their inherent rights to their natural lives.</p>

We are a group of conscientious volunteers who follow a Gandhian love based approach and hold peaceful vigils to bear witness of animals on their way to slaughter. With our campaigns of information, we make the public aware of the conditions in which animals used for food are raised, transported, and slaughtered. Our goals are to put “glass walls” on factory farms, live markets, and slaughterhouses in the Kansas City Area; and contribute to the public debate about the place of animals in our society.</p> 
<p>​We are an inclusive group that welcomes vegans and non-vegans alike. We educate people on the benefits of a vegan lifestyle, the unique and distinctive personalities of farmed animals (like those we recognize in companion animals) and their inherent rights to their natural lives.</p>

Our two parties are producing zero results for the American people, as they are more focused on running to the extremes to win elections than coming to center to solve problems. The political pendulum swings back and forth, but very little is getting done. It’s time to change the equation. The Centrist Project aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty. We are a 21st Century political organization dedicated to organizing Centrist voters and supporting independent candidates who desire to put our country ahead of any political faction in order to solve problems. We are organizing a grassroots movement of Americans –– Democrats, Republicans, and independents –– who feel left behind by both parties and who want our leaders to work together to get things done. Through our Centrist Chapters and Membership Program, we are giving a voice to the silent majority. <br><a href=""https://www.CentristProject.org"" class=""linkified"">https://www.CentristProject.org</a></p>","","","","","","","24426316","open","","","","","","","39.1","https://www.meetup.com/Kansas-City-Politics-Meetup/","USA","Kansas City, MO","-94.6","12","4","13","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Kansas City Centrists","","","","","","","221582917","Unite America","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/4/6/4/highres_274786180.jpeg","274786180","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/4/6/4/member_274786180.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/4/6/4/thumb_274786180.jpeg","member","1.0","MO","active","US/Central","Kansas-City-Politics-Meetup","public","Members","13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Kansas City","US","1072206325000","The Kansas City Objectivists is a group of about 60 members.

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Overland Park","US","1513860093000","<p>The League of Women Voters (LWV) encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy. The League is a nonpartisan organization that works to register voters, provide voters with election information through voter guides as well as candidate forums and debates.</p>
<p>Did you know:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;More than 40% of eligible Kansas voters didn't vote in 2016.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Kansas has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the United States. It is one of the few states to require both voter ID at polling places and proof of citizenship when registering to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Since 2011, the “proof of citizenship” requirement has disenfranchised tens of thousands of potential voters. For example, in 2016, only 7,444 of the 22,000 voter registration applications submitted February 1 through February 21 were completed with proof of citizenship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;That means more than 66% of applicants had their voter registrations immediately ""suspended,"" and suspended registrants were purged from the voter rolls within 90 days&nbsp;if documentation requirements are not met. Because suspended voters are purged on a rolling basis, it is hard to give an exact number, but at least 37,000 were disenfranchised at one point in 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;This disproportionately impacts young voters, ages 18 through 29. Though they represent only 14.9% of the electorate, they make up more than 58% of suspended applicants registered through the Motor Vehicle Department.&nbsp;</p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Overland Park","US","1513860093000","<p>The League of Women Voters (LWV) encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy. The League is a nonpartisan organization that works to register voters, provide voters with election information through voter guides as well as candidate forums and debates.</p>
<p>Did you know:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;More than 40% of eligible Kansas voters didn't vote in 2016.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Kansas has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the United States. It is one of the few states to require both voter ID at polling places and proof of citizenship when registering to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Since 2011, the “proof of citizenship” requirement has disenfranchised tens of thousands of potential voters. For example, in 2016, only 7,444 of the 22,000 voter registration applications submitted February 1 through February 21 were completed with proof of citizenship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;That means more than 66% of applicants had their voter registrations immediately ""suspended,"" and suspended registrants were purged from the voter rolls within 90 days&nbsp;if documentation requirements are not met. Because suspended voters are purged on a rolling basis, it is hard to give an exact number, but at least 37,000 were disenfranchised at one point in 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;This disproportionately impacts young voters, ages 18 through 29. Though they represent only 14.9% of the electorate, they make up more than 58% of suspended applicants registered through the Motor Vehicle Department.&nbsp;</p>

We CAN handle the truth and know it is ugly. This is a place to meet others who recognize that we are in an information war and are willing to fight against corruption despite the difficulties.</p>
<p><b>Places to find truthful information:</b></p>
<p><b>Infowars.com</b> - includes an Internet radio show M-F 11am to 3pm, replayed continuously until the next show.&nbsp; They have several reporters and are rapidly expanding as of June - July 2017.&nbsp; Their information sources include insiders in police and sheriff's departments, FBI, NSA, CIA, Secret Service, Homeland Security, U.S. military services, etc. - all the way up to and including President Trump himself.&nbsp; Because of their inside sources, they are able to be first to break many new stories.&nbsp; They are very cautious to get the stories right and are quick to issue retractions when they find their information is shaky.&nbsp; Local radio programing on 1440 <b>KQAM radio</b> Sundays 5pm - 7pm. <br></p>
<p><b>PrisonPlanet.com</b> - part of Infowars.com</p>
<p><b>DrudgeReport.com</b> - National headlines with links to stories</p>
<p><b>WND.com </b>- World Net Daily has many reporters and writers.&nbsp; They have a long list of new stories daily and an extensive archive.</p>
<p><b>TV</b> - Local channel 26.10 ""Vibrant"" carries InfoWars programming.<br></p>
<p>Radio station <b>TXLR</b> (Texas Liberty Radio) plays the full 10 hours of the InfoWars radio programming live Monday through Friday from 8:00am to 6:00pm CDT.&nbsp; It is also on Sundays from 4:00pm to 6:00pm. For Android phone users you can listen to this programming via the TuneIn App.</p>
<p>8:00am - 11:00am M-F&nbsp;&nbsp; David Knight on the Real News Show <br></p>
<p>11:00am - 3:00pm M-F&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show <br></p>
<p>3:00pm - 6:00pm M-F&nbsp;&nbsp; Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone on the War Room Show.</p>
<p>4:00pm to 6:00pm Sunday Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show.</p>
<p><b>Goals:</b></p>
<p>To cooperate and coordinate with others who oppose corruption and lawlessness.&nbsp; The U.S. is about to be destroyed.&nbsp; Her detractors have been plotting her destruction since before the U.S. was established and they have been successful in placing their people in strategic positions in all levels of government, the news media, the education establishment, the churches, etc.&nbsp; We have been given a reprieve, a delay in the destruction, but it will last only a few short years.&nbsp; We must use this time well.&nbsp; Our lives, and those of our children and grandchildren depend on what we do now.&nbsp; <br></p>

Our two parties are producing zero results for the American people, as they are more focused on running to the extremes to win elections than coming to center to solve problems. The political pendulum swings back and forth, but very little is getting done. It’s time to change the equation.</p> 
<p>We’re surrounded by innovation every day. Companies and organizations that weren’t around ten years ago have revolutionized the way we travel, communicate, entertain, live, and learn. But in politics, we’re stuck with two choices that most of us don’t like. We think some innovation is long overdue to make our politics more representative of and responsive to all Americans.</p> 
<p>Unite America aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty.

We believe in the 9 Principles and 12 Values set forth by the national The912Project, and shall pursue the preservation of the government promised us by the Constitution of the United States of America.  To that end, we support activites and causes that promote the 9 Principles and 12 Values.

It shall be our mission, working in conjunction with The912Project, to educate Nebraskans pertaining to the proper role of government as described in our Constitution, inspire Nebraskans to connect with one another in a constructive manner, and provide for a large and peaceful movement for Nebraskans who wish to preserve a United States government that is a government by the people and for the people.

The day and which we live is a time where sin abounds and sometimes it can be depressing to those who want to live a fun life but find that the only place to be social is at a bar or other places that you don't care to go. This group is open to anyone who wants to fellowship with other Christians, though the group will be geared more toward those between 18 and 40. We will spend our time exploring Omaha, whether that be going to an ice cream shop, going for a boat ride down at the river/Heartland pond, walking in the Old Market, having a board game night, going for a bike ride, or anything else you can think of.

Enough is Enough.</p>
<p>The goal of the group is to RESTORE both our Constitutional &amp; Civil Rights that have&nbsp; been taken away and to Protect and Defend&nbsp;the Rights we still have. The upcoming election is a battle for&nbsp; the heart and soul of our country and it is not hyperbole to say that the future of this country is&nbsp; truly a matter of life and death for the American people. &amp; Honestly, too many men and&nbsp; women have given their health and lives to keep us safe and secure. Too many Americans&nbsp; have fought to protect and Uphold the Constitution, All the while defending our&nbsp;families, freedoms, &amp;&nbsp;rights, as well as the many programs that have helped save millions of American lives.&nbsp; These are programs that gave Americans a hand up in times of need, Programs that may of our current members of Congress benefitted from, but they Do Not want others to have the same chance, This MUST be Changed&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Time has come for us to Speak the Truth, Even if your voice Shakes, Knees get weak,&nbsp;and You may be Shunned, The Truth has to be Spoken &amp; Acknowledged, even though we may not like it. Too many Innocent people have&nbsp; died and are being killed because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; rise of Racist, Bigoted, Hatred of not just the usual suspects but are being led by a National Political Party and a National Media company. And all this because we&nbsp; voted for&nbsp; a Bi-racial American Man, Instead of&nbsp; a Warmonger &amp; White man. It is clear by their Actions We have not come as far as we thought on Racism &amp; Bigotry.&nbsp;We Finally have to Admit that the Hatred is still&nbsp;alive and well in our&nbsp; country. So;</p>
<p>THIS IS YOUR CALL TO ACTION, It is Time To Restore the 4 Freedoms that this Country was&nbsp; built on, In case You Do Not Know them they are as follows, as FDR expressed&nbsp; them in his famous&nbsp; speech:</p>
<p>(1) Freedom Of Speech</p>
<p>(2) Freedom Of &amp; From Religion</p>
<p>(3) Freedom From Want</p>
<p>(4) Freedom From Fear</p>
<p>This is the United States Our Founding Fathers Established, A Nation that ""ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL"" IN BOTH THE EYES OF GOD &amp; MAN! We Must NEVER Forget We Are All Americans, and Those who support &amp; Promote Hatred Has NO Place in Our Country.</p>
<p>If You Feel the Same Way, I Sincerely Hope that You will Join Us as We Take Our Country Back, &amp; Restore and Protect The Constitution, As we should have done all these years, Instead of Allowing the Extremist to dictate what we can and cannot do, what&nbsp; they will acknowledge and&nbsp; what&nbsp; they ignore.</p>

<p>Citizens' Climate Lobby (New Orleans Chapter) advocates for free market solutions to climate change. We're STRICTLY non-partisan, and engage everyone. Over 400 chapters nationwide are developing relationships with all 535 members of US Congress to ask them for a sensible, cost-effective policy to address climate change. Here at home, we engage industry (e.g. healthcare, agriculture, oil/gas), local media, community groups (e.g. faith, military), and others to understand their concerns and present our proposal.

<p>Citizens' Climate Lobby (New Orleans Chapter) advocates for free market solutions to climate change. We're STRICTLY non-partisan, and engage everyone. Over 400 chapters nationwide are developing relationships with all 535 members of US Congress to ask them for a sensible, cost-effective policy to address climate change. Here at home, we engage industry (e.g. healthcare, agriculture, oil/gas), local media, community groups (e.g. faith, military), and others to understand their concerns and present our proposal.

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Kenner","US","1422331611000","<p> The Purpose of this group, Is to Issue A&nbsp;Call to Action to those of you who value your Rights and Freedoms, A Call for us to&nbsp;work together to&nbsp;protect and defend the Constitution which has been under assault&nbsp; and ignored by the United States Supreme Court since 2000 and by not just the U.S. Congress but the State Legislatures since 2007. Enough is Enough.</p>
<p>The goal of the group is to RESTORE both our Constitutional &amp; Civil Rights that have&nbsp; been taken away and to Protect and Defend&nbsp;the Rights we still have. The upcoming election is a battle for&nbsp; the heart and soul of our country and it is not hyperbole to say that the future of this country is&nbsp; truly a matter of life and death for the American people. &amp; Honestly, too many men and&nbsp; women have given their health and lives to keep us safe and secure. Too many Americans&nbsp; have fought to protect and Uphold the Constitution, All the while defending our&nbsp;families, freedoms, &amp;&nbsp;rights, as well as the many programs that have helped save millions of American lives.&nbsp; These are programs that gave Americans a hand up in times of need, Programs that may of our current members of Congress benefitted from, but they Do Not want others to have the same chance, This MUST be Changed&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Time has come for us to Speak the Truth, Even if your voice Shakes, Knees get weak,&nbsp;and You may be Shunned, The Truth has to be Spoken &amp; Acknowledged, even though we may not like it. Too many Innocent people have&nbsp; died and are being killed because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; rise of Racist, Bigoted, Hatred of not just the usual suspects but are being led by a National Political Party and a National Media company. And all this because we&nbsp; voted for&nbsp; a Bi-racial American Man, Instead of&nbsp; a Warmonger &amp; White man. It is clear by their Actions We have not come as far as we thought on Racism &amp; Bigotry.&nbsp;We Finally have to Admit that the Hatred is still&nbsp;alive and well in our&nbsp; country. So;</p>
<p>THIS IS YOUR CALL TO ACTION, It is Time To Restore the 4 Freedoms that this Country was&nbsp; built on, In case You Do Not Know them they are as follows, as FDR expressed&nbsp; them in his famous&nbsp; speech:</p>
<p>(1) Freedom Of Speech</p>
<p>(2) Freedom Of &amp; From Religion</p>
<p>(3) Freedom From Want</p>
<p>(4) Freedom From Fear</p>
<p>This is the United States Our Founding Fathers Established, A Nation that ""ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL"" IN BOTH THE EYES OF GOD &amp; MAN! We Must NEVER Forget We Are All Americans, and Those who support &amp; Promote Hatred Has NO Place in Our Country.</p>
<p>If You Feel the Same Way, I Sincerely Hope that You will Join Us as We Take Our Country Back, &amp; Restore and Protect The Constitution, As we should have done all these years, Instead of Allowing the Extremist to dictate what we can and cannot do, what&nbsp; they will acknowledge and&nbsp; what&nbsp; they ignore.</p>

<p>Citizens' Climate Lobby (New Orleans Chapter) advocates for free market solutions to climate change. We're STRICTLY non-partisan, and engage everyone. Over 400 chapters nationwide are developing relationships with all 535 members of US Congress to ask them for a sensible, cost-effective policy to address climate change. Here at home, we engage industry (e.g. healthcare, agriculture, oil/gas), local media, community groups (e.g. faith, military), and others to understand their concerns and present our proposal.

<p>Citizens' Climate Lobby (New Orleans Chapter) advocates for free market solutions to climate change. We're STRICTLY non-partisan, and engage everyone. Over 400 chapters nationwide are developing relationships with all 535 members of US Congress to ask them for a sensible, cost-effective policy to address climate change. Here at home, we engage industry (e.g. healthcare, agriculture, oil/gas), local media, community groups (e.g. faith, military), and others to understand their concerns and present our proposal.

<p>This ""intro"" is becoming quite an essay, but maybe that's OK.</p>
<p>I am very much looking for a first-rate thinker for a friend ,,,, someone who really ""gets it"".</p>
<p><b>Now, For those interested in, but UNFAMILIAR with, Objectivism:</b></p>
<p>If you like philosophy and are looking for a better system of thinking, you have stumbled onto a special place!</p>
<p>Objectivism is a point of view developed by Russian immigrant, novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, during the middle of the 1900's. &nbsp;Since none of us can invent everything we know from scratch, we all need a high quality framework of ideas to think from.&nbsp; Whether Objectivism is the final philosophy one should use or not, it is that high quality framework of ideas needed to think from.&nbsp; All other points of view have been found to be inferior.&nbsp; Objectivism also made the first big ""splash"" in the world as the viable alternative to left and right wing political theory.</p>
<p>The basics of Objectivism are really quite simple, but it takes a lot of great thinking to ""get it"",&nbsp; UN-LEARN all the garbage that has gotten into your head, and see how the ideas fit together and apply to everyday issues.&nbsp; If you are dedicated to the whole truth of all matters, then this is for you.&nbsp; Some things you may have heard about Objectivism, or what positions a good Objectivist thinker would take, may be inaccurate. For example; Objectivism emphasizes ""production"", in contrast to ""consumption"". Proper Objectivists live GOOD lives, but they are not ""materialistic"", nor are they ""greedy"" capitalists.&nbsp; Certain self described Objectivists are poor examples of its expression and do disservice to it.&nbsp; Some well known figures seem to be profiteering&nbsp; from it (see note at bottom of page).&nbsp; Certain young followers sense something is special, but might lack the experience, maturity or aptitude to fully understand or practice it well.&nbsp; Many people who are attracted to Objectivism are never able to fully ""get it"", or apply it well.&nbsp; Most people who don't really understand the system eventually just drop out.</p>
<p>I recently read an article that points out the importance of being able to ""think things all the way through"".&nbsp; I thought that was a nice way to put that.</p>
<p>Consider giving the Objectivist outlook a try and do your own thinking. Contact the group and discuss, question, or challenge.&nbsp; When learning to understand life it is important to recognize those who do have a better grasp than oneself and LEARN something from them.</p>
<p>The Objectivist way of thinking is for good people who want to lead good lives.</p>
<p><b>SOME WORDS FOR THOSE FAMILIAR WITH OBJECTIVISM:</b></p>
<p>I have been disappointed in the ""mainstream"" Objectivist organizations.&nbsp; My attitude toward the Objectivist movement is well embodied in the following thought:&nbsp; “any good idea will attract all manner of people, with all manner of abilities"".&nbsp; I see Objectivist organizations as either too reluctant to take positions, or else taking too many wrong positions.&nbsp; It seems there aren't enough Objectivists who really ""get it"".</p>
<p>If my thinking thus far interests you, then read on.</p>
<p>I'm not about endless discussions of Epistemology.&nbsp; Scholars are groping to find out exactly how the human brain mechanically does what it does, and that is ok.&nbsp; But fortunately, complete knowledge of HOW the brain accomplishes reason is not at all necessary, and more than a few ""objectivists"" use these discussions as a diversionary and delay tactic.&nbsp; All theories on just how the brain does what it does are just that, THEORIES!&nbsp; I will say, however, that I think the ""filing cabinet"" analogy of the brain is very good and may explain a lot.&nbsp; What IS necessary for right thinking is true intellectual independence, intellectual curiosity, and intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how I think regarding the ""dispute"" between some Objectivists and modern science.&nbsp; For the most part, sincere theoretical scientists are doing their best to understand the universe, and the fact that classical and modern physics are different things has no bearing on philosophical conclusions in ethics or politics.&nbsp; No scientific theory on the behavior sub-atomic particles, the ""big bang"", or the behavior of things around black holes could ever have any effect on proper ethical or political conclusions.&nbsp; Man inhabits the world at HIS scale, and there is certainty at HIS scale!!</p>
<p>While I'm at it I'll assert that Objectivists attempts to prove the non-existence of a God are as silly as attempts of theists to prove that there is one.&nbsp; As philosophers we are under the mandate to not attempt to prove a negative.&nbsp; You cannot prove that there is no god.&nbsp; I'm aware of Peikoff's agrument in OPAR.&nbsp; It is flawed with logical fallacies.&nbsp; All one can formally say about the matter is that existence exists, and leave it at that. &nbsp;Serious speculation on matters prior to, or outside of existence is the problem ---- and it is perfectly OK to speculate about it ---- non-seriously !!</p>
<p>Our purpose here is to provide contact (intellectual or otherwise) for independent idea loving people.&nbsp; The small group is currently communicating by regular Email at&nbsp;<b>rodney203@aol.com</b></p>
<p>Although the name ""Independent Objectivist"" is technically a redundancy, I regret that it is a necessary one for the forseeable future in the Objectivist community.</p>
<p>I am ""Objectivist based"". Ayn Rand is credited as being the most generally honest, thorough and correct modern philosopher; her works putting so many ideas together in one neat package to be considered- akin to the “Theory of Relativity” in physics.&nbsp; The ideas set forth by Rand and others is the most logically consistent and ""proven"" philosophy of which I am aware.&nbsp; No other system has gone to such great lengths to ""prove"" its ideas.&nbsp; I'm not overly concerned with which ideas were Rand's original insights- she put it all together in one place, with the interpretations that she made, and that's important.&nbsp; <br> <br>Otherwise, it is not my intent&nbsp; to adulterate / corrupt what is considered to be Objectivism. We are solid friends of the Objectivist way of thinking; however, since philosophy is a human observation, all peoples’ inductions and deductions are at least subject to sincere inquiry and evaluation.&nbsp; Ideas can be ignored, misused or misapplied by anyone.&nbsp; We are looking for the truth of matters.&nbsp; What is needed most are people who can achieve a decent deduction of existing Objectivist theory to all aspects of daily life.</p>
<p>Here are a few additional examples of positions I hold:&nbsp; That Objectivism is a theory and set of principles, and NOT a set of conclusions.&nbsp; If one is under the impression that some particular conclusion is the ""correct"" Objectivist position, do not assume that I automatically agree with it, (and I may very well agree with it); though MANY conclusions in the Objectivist movement are quite obvious.&nbsp; I believe that existing Objectivist NONFICTION materials on close relationships, love and sex is actually lacking in the logical rigor found in some other of its other topics - reading more like instructions for writing romance novels than something from a logical philosophy (note: I have now read Atlas Shrugged and I have no major complaints on the romantic accounts there.&nbsp; I have also been reading some books lately from the ""men's rights/men's awareness"" movement, and it seems to me that Objectivist leaders have some explaining to do regarding their superficial and somewhat mystic coverage of relationships and sex.&nbsp; I suspect that the lack of proper treatment of this topic is due to the fact that it would be extremely unpopular with certain followers.&nbsp; Still, a great disservice is being done it seems.)</p>
<p>PLEASE communicate with me directly at&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:rodney203@aol.com""><b>rodney203@aol.com</b></a></p>
<p> <br><b>Group owner&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Defining ""profiteering"" in this context would be an admittedly difficult and complex task.&nbsp; I do not intend to use it here as a ""floating"" smear.&nbsp; I merely appeal to those readers who, after considerable observation and thought, think they too see that such things do happen in the Objectivist community.&nbsp; Profiteering, in this context, would have something to do with placing maintaining one's customer base above dedication to truth and reality, whether one realizes one is doing it, or not.&nbsp; In other words, being the ""witch doctor"", that Objectivists so eagerly despise.&nbsp; ""Witch Doctor"" means dealing in MIS-information!</p>
<p><b>THANKS</b></p>

There is intended to be no discussion of politics here except that of legal forms of secession, and that of how to effectively evade and counteract coercive and/or thieving behavior -- including that of government -- without resorting to government to protect us, which we know in the long run is folly.  For discussions of mainstream political issues including political activism, there are many other excellent groups to join.  This group is strictly about learning how to live independently from government, how to facilitate its dissolution into ever-smaller and more manageable units, and how to practically prepare for and survive a political or economic collapse.  In short, it is about helping people find freedom in an unfree world, as Harry Browne put it.

Interesting topics will be historical secession and Agorist movements, law and property rights issues, how agorists and agorist organizations can deal with interference by existing States, individualist philosophy, and how to build wealth outside the confines of the modern systems of government that would otherwise consume most of it.

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Tulsa","US","1234312241000","This is a group formed for two purposes:  one, of finding ways to live independently from the regime in Washington D.C. as part of the Free State Project; and two, spreading the Agora -- the unfettered free market described by Samuel E. Konkin III in ""A New Libertarian Manifesto"" -- throughout the Oklahoma region.

There is intended to be no discussion of politics here except that of legal forms of secession, and that of how to effectively evade and counteract coercive and/or thieving behavior -- including that of government -- without resorting to government to protect us, which we know in the long run is folly.  For discussions of mainstream political issues including political activism, there are many other excellent groups to join.  This group is strictly about learning how to live independently from government, how to facilitate its dissolution into ever-smaller and more manageable units, and how to practically prepare for and survive a political or economic collapse.  In short, it is about helping people find freedom in an unfree world, as Harry Browne put it.

Interesting topics will be historical secession and Agorist movements, law and property rights issues, how agorists and agorist organizations can deal with interference by existing States, individualist philosophy, and how to build wealth outside the confines of the modern systems of government that would otherwise consume most of it.

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1441203278000","<p>Mission: To advance the rebirth of openly accountable constitutional and republican institutions that rigorously protect our natural rights and liberties. We are committed to truth, justice, equality, security, and peaceful solidarity among all peoples of the Earth. We must <i>be </i>the change we wish to see in the world.</p>
<p><b>We view the events of 9/11 as a massive lever that members of the power elite used to launch an unwinnable ""global war on terror,"" and rapidly reduce or eliminate our constitutional rights and protections.&nbsp; We are working in many ways with other groups toward a proper investigation of those events that will finally lead to justice for those who have paid so dearly.</b></p>
<p><b>We are also working to reverse some of the damage already done and prevent new crimes from happening. For example:</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to <b>stop the senseless wars and killing</b> innocents for empire, power, and greed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>bring our troops home and close the 800 military bases</b> we have all over the world in other people's countries.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>withdraw all the obscene trillions of dollars</b> allocated for unconstitutional wars and spend it, instead, on making America whole and strong again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to <b>bring an end to the rhetoric of hate, fear and anger</b> toward one another -- the negative energy that spawns violent acts of rage by whatever weapons are handy.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>stop the government's intrusion into the decisions of individual lives</b>, from child rearing, to the substances put in the water we drink, to the medicines and treatments we choose, to the education we provide our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;We want to <b>end the Federal Reserve and return to debt-free money</b> controlled by the US Treasury. We want our economy back in the hands of Americans, not international bankers.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;We want to <b>awaken millions more to the corruption and divisiveness</b> NOW, while we still have the freedom to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;And we want to <b>ultimately stop the corruption, prosecute the real criminals, and restore our America</b> to its founding principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not a talk therapy group, though we believe that taking meaningful action can be therapeutic for those of us whose souls have been damaged by the darkness around us. We are looking for and implementing real solutions that can have a significant impact. <b>If you are eager to make a difference, and if you have ideas or skills you think can help, we need your energy and your creativity.</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>
<p><span>See you at our next meetup!</span> <br></p>

<p>Should you become part of the Revolution? Are you a #Resister? Or are you just REALLY MAD?? The American dream is vanishing. Ordinary working people work longer hours for less money every year. The far right has fed hatred and division and pushed Federal and state governments to override basic freedoms and tilt the playing field so a privileged few can decide what happens to all the rest of us. Our Revolution wants ordinary Americans to be free of hunger, able earn a living wage, have healthcare regardless of preexisting conditions, and have fully funded Social Security and tax deferred savings programs.</p>

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>
<p><span>See you at our next meetup!</span> <br></p>

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1283028975000","<p>The short story is that we're just a bunch of Democrats who meet for Happy Hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But being a Democrat isn't the point. And I don't mean to suggest that you have to identify as a Democrat to be here. No, that's not it at all -- but that's probably the word most people are familiar with. We're not looking for labels and we have no agenda. We're just a bunch of forward thinking liberals (i.e., liberally thinking people) who appreciate each others' company. And the second Tuesday of every month is when we make an extra special effort to hang out with our favorite bartender. (Patricia is awesome.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we talk politics and sometimes we don't. We're very welcoming, but if you classify yourself as a red, red Republican, then this group isn't for you. And if you're just curious, come on down!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Another thing to note: even though we have no agenda, we *are* welcoming to candidates during election season. We won't endorse anyone, but we're happy to have candidates come out to kiss hands and shake babies. After all, isn't it important for us to be engaged? (Hint: YES.)&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p> <br>DISCLAIMER: Yes, we like booze. Goodness, we're meeting in a bar! But please be responsible with your &nbsp;intake. Also, this group was formerly called Dallas Drinking Liberally, the Dallas Chapter of the national organization of&nbsp;<a href=""http://livingliberally.org/"">Living Liberally.org.</a>&nbsp;But that is no longer the case.

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1145797329000","<p>We call ourselves<b> “North Texans for 9/11 Truth” </b>and/or<b> “North Texans for Truth”.&nbsp; </b>We began in 2006.</p>
<p><b>Our MISSION is simple:&nbsp; <i>We endeavor to make a better world by educating ourselves and others.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Our ACTIVITIES </b>– We do what we can do on a local level with the resources at hand.&nbsp; Over the years we have accomplished hundreds of actions.&nbsp; (Examples: Giving our more than 69,000 DVDs, literally tons of literature, putting on events &amp; films at theatres and colleges, bringing in famous guest speakers, advertising “the truth”, flying a banner over The Byron Nelson &amp; DFW area, participating in protests and sign waves, being featured in local and international news articles, etc.)&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Our TOPICS</b> – Our topics of discussion and involvement include 9/11, deceptions, frauds, manipulations, false flag events, natural health, fluoride, alternative energy, the environment, gardening, permaculture, healthy food, weather manipulation, philosophy, politics, spiritual growth, personal enlightenment, music, art, education, money &amp; finance &amp; business, etc.</p>
<p><b>9/11/2001 </b>– We generally focus on the topic of 9/11, especially “Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth”&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.ae911truth.org/"">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a>&nbsp; We consider the fraud of 9/11 as foundational.&nbsp; Once an individual becomes aware of the fraud of 9/11, the person often “goes down the rabbit hole” and explores the many other deceptions which exist.&nbsp; The other frauds start to collapse once a person awakens to the 9/11 fraud.&nbsp; (5 minutes – The Official 9/11 Story - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98</a> )</p>
<p><b>EVOLUTION</b> –&nbsp; An evolution in awareness occurs as a person discovers the deceptions.&nbsp; Often a person continues to research, gain knowledge and become more enlightened.&nbsp; At a certain stage in maturity, an individual recognizes that it is important to <i>“do something”</i> .</p>
<p><b>JOIN US</b> – Please join us.&nbsp; Take the journey.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter what stage you are at…whether you are “just curious”, a beginner, or you already have done lots of research, or you have evolved into the higher echelon of wanting to actively participate in bettering conditions and opening people’s minds.</p>
<p><b>WE DON’T SPY </b>– We don’t spy on you.&nbsp; We don’t monitor nor try to manipulate you.&nbsp; If you are concerned about the government monitoring your actions when you join…Well, the government already has a record of your every web search, phone calls, your finances, your associates, and much of your personal life including intimate details.</p>
<p><b>This is a fun, friendly group full of intelligent, talented, like-minded people whose motivation is TRUTH and COMPASSION.</b></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1239158229000","<p>WE ARE much more than just A 9-12 GROUP FOR ALL TEXANS. If any unconstitutional act of government is illegitimate then the people have a duty to withdraw their consent to that act, as provided by the maxim of law providing that the lesser power is INCLUDED in the greater. This group will use DIRECT ACTIVISM and THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE to PETITION the State of Texas to REJECT AND RESCIND all UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWS and ACTS passed in the Texas and United States Legislatures. This Right of We the People is well described in the FIRST AMENDMENT which states in part, ""...the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.""</p>
<p>A constitution is analogous to a limited power of attorney. For the purpose of the relationship, the people are sovereign; and the government their agent. The constitution both grants power and LIMITS power granted.</p>
<p>As members of the sovereignty, to remain consistent with the principles of the declaration of independence, the American people have a duty not to dignify a statute passed that is repugnant to the constitution. In truth, if the agent (government) has transgressed the principal's (We the People) delegation of power, the principal has a duty to call the agent on it to avoid giving the appearance of consent. The American people have a duty not to consent to an unconstitutional act masquerading as law.</p>
<p>We seek to gather all Texans to stand together against DESPOTIC ACTS AND LAWS BY THE GOVERNMENT IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.</p>
<p>This is NOT a ""secessionist"" group per se, besides Texas already seceded from Mexico in 1836 just as America seceded from England in 1776. However, we reserve the right to pursue any and all peaceful, non-violent measures, including political action, nullification, negotiating a new arrangement, or even (as a last resort) full independence for Texas if that's what it takes to restore our freedom. Even if it comes to that, we would be happy to restore the REAL Texas and the REAL America and maintain that relationship.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that America and Texas were founded upon the principles described at the Common Law Institute at <a href=""http://common-law.net/nap.html"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://common-law.net/nap.html"" target=""_blank"">http://common-law.net/nap.html</a> and we intend to peacefully restore legitimate governments that adhere to those principles instead of violating them.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/2/highres_100281202.jpeg","100281202","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/2/600_100281202.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/2/thumb_100281202.jpeg","event","1429141","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/4/5/highres_8805381.jpeg","8805381","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/4/5/600_8805381.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/4/5/thumb_8805381.jpeg","event","32.77","https://www.meetup.com/Texans-for-Freedom/","USA","Dallas, TX","-96.68","180","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Texans for Freedom","","","","","","Why I want a local meetup depends on which meetup we're talking about; I have many interests.","4311598","Gned the Gnome","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/6/0/highres_3422912.jpeg","3422912","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/6/0/member_3422912.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/6/0/thumb_3422912.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Texans-for-Freedom","public","Texans for Freedom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>
<p><span>See you at our next meetup!</span> <br></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1441203278000","<p>Mission: To advance the rebirth of openly accountable constitutional and republican institutions that rigorously protect our natural rights and liberties. We are committed to truth, justice, equality, security, and peaceful solidarity among all peoples of the Earth. We must <i>be </i>the change we wish to see in the world.</p>
<p><b>We view the events of 9/11 as a massive lever that members of the power elite used to launch an unwinnable ""global war on terror,"" and rapidly reduce or eliminate our constitutional rights and protections.&nbsp; We are working in many ways with other groups toward a proper investigation of those events that will finally lead to justice for those who have paid so dearly.</b></p>
<p><b>We are also working to reverse some of the damage already done and prevent new crimes from happening. For example:</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to <b>stop the senseless wars and killing</b> innocents for empire, power, and greed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>bring our troops home and close the 800 military bases</b> we have all over the world in other people's countries.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>withdraw all the obscene trillions of dollars</b> allocated for unconstitutional wars and spend it, instead, on making America whole and strong again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to <b>bring an end to the rhetoric of hate, fear and anger</b> toward one another -- the negative energy that spawns violent acts of rage by whatever weapons are handy.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>stop the government's intrusion into the decisions of individual lives</b>, from child rearing, to the substances put in the water we drink, to the medicines and treatments we choose, to the education we provide our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;We want to <b>end the Federal Reserve and return to debt-free money</b> controlled by the US Treasury. We want our economy back in the hands of Americans, not international bankers.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;We want to <b>awaken millions more to the corruption and divisiveness</b> NOW, while we still have the freedom to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;And we want to <b>ultimately stop the corruption, prosecute the real criminals, and restore our America</b> to its founding principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not a talk therapy group, though we believe that taking meaningful action can be therapeutic for those of us whose souls have been damaged by the darkness around us. We are looking for and implementing real solutions that can have a significant impact. <b>If you are eager to make a difference, and if you have ideas or skills you think can help, we need your energy and your creativity.</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>

<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>

<p>Should you become part of the Revolution? Are you a #Resister? Or are you just REALLY MAD?? The American dream is vanishing. Ordinary working people work longer hours for less money every year. The far right has fed hatred and division and pushed Federal and state governments to override basic freedoms and tilt the playing field so a privileged few can decide what happens to all the rest of us. Our Revolution wants ordinary Americans to be free of hunger, able earn a living wage, have healthcare regardless of preexisting conditions, and have fully funded Social Security and tax deferred savings programs.</p>

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>
<p><span>See you at our next meetup!</span> <br></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1441203278000","<p>Mission: To advance the rebirth of openly accountable constitutional and republican institutions that rigorously protect our natural rights and liberties. We are committed to truth, justice, equality, security, and peaceful solidarity among all peoples of the Earth. We must <i>be </i>the change we wish to see in the world.</p>
<p><b>We view the events of 9/11 as a massive lever that members of the power elite used to launch an unwinnable ""global war on terror,"" and rapidly reduce or eliminate our constitutional rights and protections.&nbsp; We are working in many ways with other groups toward a proper investigation of those events that will finally lead to justice for those who have paid so dearly.</b></p>
<p><b>We are also working to reverse some of the damage already done and prevent new crimes from happening. For example:</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to <b>stop the senseless wars and killing</b> innocents for empire, power, and greed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>bring our troops home and close the 800 military bases</b> we have all over the world in other people's countries.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>withdraw all the obscene trillions of dollars</b> allocated for unconstitutional wars and spend it, instead, on making America whole and strong again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to <b>bring an end to the rhetoric of hate, fear and anger</b> toward one another -- the negative energy that spawns violent acts of rage by whatever weapons are handy.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; We want to <b>stop the government's intrusion into the decisions of individual lives</b>, from child rearing, to the substances put in the water we drink, to the medicines and treatments we choose, to the education we provide our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;We want to <b>end the Federal Reserve and return to debt-free money</b> controlled by the US Treasury. We want our economy back in the hands of Americans, not international bankers.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;We want to <b>awaken millions more to the corruption and divisiveness</b> NOW, while we still have the freedom to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;And we want to <b>ultimately stop the corruption, prosecute the real criminals, and restore our America</b> to its founding principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not a talk therapy group, though we believe that taking meaningful action can be therapeutic for those of us whose souls have been damaged by the darkness around us. We are looking for and implementing real solutions that can have a significant impact. <b>If you are eager to make a difference, and if you have ideas or skills you think can help, we need your energy and your creativity.</b>&nbsp;</p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1283028975000","<p>The short story is that we're just a bunch of Democrats who meet for Happy Hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But being a Democrat isn't the point. And I don't mean to suggest that you have to identify as a Democrat to be here. No, that's not it at all -- but that's probably the word most people are familiar with. We're not looking for labels and we have no agenda. We're just a bunch of forward thinking liberals (i.e., liberally thinking people) who appreciate each others' company. And the second Tuesday of every month is when we make an extra special effort to hang out with our favorite bartender. (Patricia is awesome.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we talk politics and sometimes we don't. We're very welcoming, but if you classify yourself as a red, red Republican, then this group isn't for you. And if you're just curious, come on down!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Another thing to note: even though we have no agenda, we *are* welcoming to candidates during election season. We won't endorse anyone, but we're happy to have candidates come out to kiss hands and shake babies. After all, isn't it important for us to be engaged? (Hint: YES.)&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p> <br>DISCLAIMER: Yes, we like booze. Goodness, we're meeting in a bar! But please be responsible with your &nbsp;intake. Also, this group was formerly called Dallas Drinking Liberally, the Dallas Chapter of the national organization of&nbsp;<a href=""http://livingliberally.org/"">Living Liberally.org.</a>&nbsp;But that is no longer the case.

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1239158229000","<p>WE ARE much more than just A 9-12 GROUP FOR ALL TEXANS. If any unconstitutional act of government is illegitimate then the people have a duty to withdraw their consent to that act, as provided by the maxim of law providing that the lesser power is INCLUDED in the greater. This group will use DIRECT ACTIVISM and THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE to PETITION the State of Texas to REJECT AND RESCIND all UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWS and ACTS passed in the Texas and United States Legislatures. This Right of We the People is well described in the FIRST AMENDMENT which states in part, ""...the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.""</p>
<p>A constitution is analogous to a limited power of attorney. For the purpose of the relationship, the people are sovereign; and the government their agent. The constitution both grants power and LIMITS power granted.</p>
<p>As members of the sovereignty, to remain consistent with the principles of the declaration of independence, the American people have a duty not to dignify a statute passed that is repugnant to the constitution. In truth, if the agent (government) has transgressed the principal's (We the People) delegation of power, the principal has a duty to call the agent on it to avoid giving the appearance of consent. The American people have a duty not to consent to an unconstitutional act masquerading as law.</p>
<p>We seek to gather all Texans to stand together against DESPOTIC ACTS AND LAWS BY THE GOVERNMENT IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.</p>
<p>This is NOT a ""secessionist"" group per se, besides Texas already seceded from Mexico in 1836 just as America seceded from England in 1776. However, we reserve the right to pursue any and all peaceful, non-violent measures, including political action, nullification, negotiating a new arrangement, or even (as a last resort) full independence for Texas if that's what it takes to restore our freedom. Even if it comes to that, we would be happy to restore the REAL Texas and the REAL America and maintain that relationship.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that America and Texas were founded upon the principles described at the Common Law Institute at <a href=""http://common-law.net/nap.html"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://common-law.net/nap.html"" target=""_blank"">http://common-law.net/nap.html</a> and we intend to peacefully restore legitimate governments that adhere to those principles instead of violating them.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/2/highres_100281202.jpeg","100281202","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/2/600_100281202.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/2/thumb_100281202.jpeg","event","1429141","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/4/5/highres_8805381.jpeg","8805381","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/4/5/600_8805381.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/4/5/thumb_8805381.jpeg","event","32.77","https://www.meetup.com/Texans-for-Freedom/","USA","Dallas, TX","-96.68","180","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Texans for Freedom","","","","","","Why I want a local meetup depends on which meetup we're talking about; I have many interests.","4311598","Gned the Gnome","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/6/0/highres_3422912.jpeg","3422912","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/6/0/member_3422912.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/6/0/thumb_3422912.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Texans-for-Freedom","public","Texans for Freedom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1145797329000","<p>We call ourselves<b> “North Texans for 9/11 Truth” </b>and/or<b> “North Texans for Truth”.&nbsp; </b>We began in 2006.</p>
<p><b>Our MISSION is simple:&nbsp; <i>We endeavor to make a better world by educating ourselves and others.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Our ACTIVITIES </b>– We do what we can do on a local level with the resources at hand.&nbsp; Over the years we have accomplished hundreds of actions.&nbsp; (Examples: Giving our more than 69,000 DVDs, literally tons of literature, putting on events &amp; films at theatres and colleges, bringing in famous guest speakers, advertising “the truth”, flying a banner over The Byron Nelson &amp; DFW area, participating in protests and sign waves, being featured in local and international news articles, etc.)&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Our TOPICS</b> – Our topics of discussion and involvement include 9/11, deceptions, frauds, manipulations, false flag events, natural health, fluoride, alternative energy, the environment, gardening, permaculture, healthy food, weather manipulation, philosophy, politics, spiritual growth, personal enlightenment, music, art, education, money &amp; finance &amp; business, etc.</p>
<p><b>9/11/2001 </b>– We generally focus on the topic of 9/11, especially “Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth”&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.ae911truth.org/"">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a>&nbsp; We consider the fraud of 9/11 as foundational.&nbsp; Once an individual becomes aware of the fraud of 9/11, the person often “goes down the rabbit hole” and explores the many other deceptions which exist.&nbsp; The other frauds start to collapse once a person awakens to the 9/11 fraud.&nbsp; (5 minutes – The Official 9/11 Story - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98</a> )</p>
<p><b>EVOLUTION</b> –&nbsp; An evolution in awareness occurs as a person discovers the deceptions.&nbsp; Often a person continues to research, gain knowledge and become more enlightened.&nbsp; At a certain stage in maturity, an individual recognizes that it is important to <i>“do something”</i> .</p>
<p><b>JOIN US</b> – Please join us.&nbsp; Take the journey.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter what stage you are at…whether you are “just curious”, a beginner, or you already have done lots of research, or you have evolved into the higher echelon of wanting to actively participate in bettering conditions and opening people’s minds.</p>
<p><b>WE DON’T SPY </b>– We don’t spy on you.&nbsp; We don’t monitor nor try to manipulate you.&nbsp; If you are concerned about the government monitoring your actions when you join…Well, the government already has a record of your every web search, phone calls, your finances, your associates, and much of your personal life including intimate details.</p>
<p><b>This is a fun, friendly group full of intelligent, talented, like-minded people whose motivation is TRUTH and COMPASSION.</b></p>

<p><span>We host meetups for like-minded individuals that are friendly, frequent and fun so as best to create an environment where people can build long-term friendships and help create just a little slice of the voluntary world we all want to live in.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Voluntaryism is the belief that no one should initiate force on any other person.</i></span></p>
<p><span>The Voluntaryists of Dallas Ft Worth group is made up of people who like to get together and discuss Voluntaryism. This can be politically, socially, personally, whatever. Our goal is to build a strong community of Voluntaryists in DFW.</span></p>
<p><span>Never heard of Voluntaryism? Curious? Awesome! Wanna debate till you turn some shade of purple? Sweet! Wanna just hang out for no particular reason? Cool!</span></p>
<p><span>We cover a wide range of topics, from Market Anarchy to Peaceful Parenting. From Entrepreneurship to Personal Freedom. It's pretty much just an open discussion so come on by!</span></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Dallas","US","1145797329000","<p>We call ourselves<b> “North Texans for 9/11 Truth” </b>and/or<b> “North Texans for Truth”.&nbsp; </b>We began in 2006.</p>
<p><b>Our MISSION is simple:&nbsp; <i>We endeavor to make a better world by educating ourselves and others.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Our ACTIVITIES </b>– We do what we can do on a local level with the resources at hand.&nbsp; Over the years we have accomplished hundreds of actions.&nbsp; (Examples: Giving our more than 69,000 DVDs, literally tons of literature, putting on events &amp; films at theatres and colleges, bringing in famous guest speakers, advertising “the truth”, flying a banner over The Byron Nelson &amp; DFW area, participating in protests and sign waves, being featured in local and international news articles, etc.)&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Our TOPICS</b> – Our topics of discussion and involvement include 9/11, deceptions, frauds, manipulations, false flag events, natural health, fluoride, alternative energy, the environment, gardening, permaculture, healthy food, weather manipulation, philosophy, politics, spiritual growth, personal enlightenment, music, art, education, money &amp; finance &amp; business, etc.</p>
<p><b>9/11/2001 </b>– We generally focus on the topic of 9/11, especially “Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth”&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.ae911truth.org/"">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a>&nbsp; We consider the fraud of 9/11 as foundational.&nbsp; Once an individual becomes aware of the fraud of 9/11, the person often “goes down the rabbit hole” and explores the many other deceptions which exist.&nbsp; The other frauds start to collapse once a person awakens to the 9/11 fraud.&nbsp; (5 minutes – The Official 9/11 Story - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98</a> )</p>
<p><b>EVOLUTION</b> –&nbsp; An evolution in awareness occurs as a person discovers the deceptions.&nbsp; Often a person continues to research, gain knowledge and become more enlightened.&nbsp; At a certain stage in maturity, an individual recognizes that it is important to <i>“do something”</i> .</p>
<p><b>JOIN US</b> – Please join us.&nbsp; Take the journey.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter what stage you are at…whether you are “just curious”, a beginner, or you already have done lots of research, or you have evolved into the higher echelon of wanting to actively participate in bettering conditions and opening people’s minds.</p>
<p><b>WE DON’T SPY </b>– We don’t spy on you.&nbsp; We don’t monitor nor try to manipulate you.&nbsp; If you are concerned about the government monitoring your actions when you join…Well, the government already has a record of your every web search, phone calls, your finances, your associates, and much of your personal life including intimate details.</p>
<p><b>This is a fun, friendly group full of intelligent, talented, like-minded people whose motivation is TRUTH and COMPASSION.</b></p>

<p>Ideally, we would like to have a substantive, in-depth discussion and analysis of a political issue or topic during each meeting.&nbsp; We would also like to have members representing as many diverse viewpoints and political perspectives as possible weigh in on each issue.</p>
<p>The emphasis for each issue discussion will be as follows:</p>
<p>1. Discussion of the issue itself (agreeing on the problem to be solved and the desired outcomes).</p>
<p>2. Presentation of various proposed solutions to the problem (preferably from a variety of political perspectives).</p>
<p>3. Comparing and contrasting the proposed solutions to the problem in terms of how well they satisfy the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Again, we welcome ALL political perspectives (even those that are not so popular).&nbsp; The most interesting meetings are those that compare and contrast many perspectives on the issues.&nbsp; However, if you'd rather not voice your opinion on the issues, feel free to come and listen.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/0/highres_14879792.jpeg","14879792","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/0/600_14879792.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/0/thumb_14879792.jpeg","event","957975","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/0/highres_14879792.jpeg","14879792","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/0/600_14879792.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/0/thumb_14879792.jpeg","event","32.85","https://www.meetup.com/DFWPolitics/","USA","Euless, TX","-97.09","521","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","DFW Political and Economic Discussion Group","vbkdnyxhbtb","DFW Political and Economic Issues Discussion Meetup Group","1526432400000","-18000000","2","","1842433","Todd Hedgcoth","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/6/3/4/highres_251370260.jpeg","251370260","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/6/3/4/member_251370260.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/6/3/4/thumb_251370260.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","DFWPolitics","public","Politicos","13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Euless","US","1486183331000","<p>Concerned about where the country is heading?

Our goal is to increase our participation and influence in the political process. As a significant percentage of the population, it is past time for our political power to be recognized and respected. There are many issues we must deal with, and the only way to do that is through the ballot. Whether it’s underemployment, underpaid, police brutality, excessive incarceration, or general political apathy among us, it is time for us to act to better our lives as a whole. This group is for men and women who are done being complacent when it comes to our politicians and are looking for a way to assert themselves.

The work of the Campaign for Liberty will take many forms.  We will educate our fellow Americans in freedom, sound money, non-interventionism, and free markets.  Politically, we'll expand the great work of our precinct leader program.  We'll make our presence felt at every level of government, where just a few people with our level of enthusiasm can make a world of difference.  We'll keep an eye on Congress and lobby against legislation that threatens us.  We'll identify and support political candidates who champion our great ideas!

We will be a permanent presence on the American political landscape.  That I promise you.  We're not about to let all this good work die.  To the contrary, with your help we're going to make it grow by leaps and bounds.

TRUTH, LIBERTY and JUSTICE for ALL!
God Bless America!
God Bless Texas!
God Have Mercy on Us All


Disclaimer: This is not an ""official"" group. Though many of the members were delegates to the Texas State Liberty Convention that adopted the statement of purpose, the outline of the bylaws, much of the platform, and the name, we recognize that we really have very little right to the name ""Texas Liberty Campaign."" However, we are proud of the name and will seek an official relationship with the Texas Liberty Campaign when that option becomes available.","","","","","","","523617","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/f/9/highres_468929433.jpeg","468929433","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/f/9/600_468929433.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/f/9/thumb_468929433.jpeg","event","33.22","https://www.meetup.com/tlcdenton/","USA","Denton, TX","-97.14","154","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Texas Liberty Campaign - Denton County","","","","","","","4881189","Kurt Hyde","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/5/4/highres_3180340.jpeg","3180340","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/5/4/member_3180340.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/5/4/thumb_3180340.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","tlcdenton","public_limited","Denton Patriots","13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Denton","US","1486183340000","<p>Concerned about where the country is heading?

We'll make our presence felt at every level of government, where just a few people with our level of enthusiasm can make a world of difference.  We'll keep an eye on Congress and lobby against legislation that threatens us.  We'll identify and support political candidates who champion our great ideas!

We will be a permanent presence on the American political landscape.  That I promise you.  We're not about to let all this good work die.  To the contrary, with your help we're going to make it grow by leaps and bounds.

TRUTH, LIBERTY and JUSTICE for ALL!
God Bless America!
God Bless Texas!
God Have Mercy on Us All

<p>We’re surrounded by innovation every day. Companies and organizations that weren’t around ten years ago have revolutionized the way we travel, communicate, entertain, live, and learn. But in politics, we’re stuck with two choices that most of us don’t like. We think some innovation is long overdue to make our politics more representative of and responsive to all Americans.</p>
<p>Unite America aims to reshape and reform our political system – not as a traditional third party, but as America’s first Unparty.

Feeling deprived of meaningful connections with people of substance - then you should definitely join. If you no longer have the patience for small talk, forced friendships, and feel like there is a lot on your mind but noone to share it with, you may have just found a delightful outlet for your mental energy. If you would rather discuss the meaning of life with a good friend at a coffee shop then getting jiggy at a club at the club, look no more! We realize that in order to change the world we first need to change our world. Often it all starts with connecting with people who vibrate on the same wavelength as you do. What are you passionate about? Climate change, social justice, national politics, religion, science, gun violence, racism - whatever it is, we welcome these topics at our round table. The issues we will discuss and debate are definitely not limited to the ones of global magnitude. Art, culture, history, health, love, sexuality, money, friendships, self-actualization, addiction, pursuit of happiness - there will definitely be a meetup for all these important matters. There are no restrictions on who can join - whether you're a liberal or conservative, christian, muslim or atheist, as long as you're able to hold a civilized discussion - you're welcome here!</p>

<p>Washington is broken.  The two major parties have been corrupted by the rich and powerful and cannot be reformed.   Our only hope to save our liberty, our Constitution, and our country is to push back on Washington here in Texas by resisting unconstitutional federal acts through nullification.  Only the Texas Libertarian Party can be counted on to follow this course.          </p>
<p>Today, this becomes the official meetup of the Harris County Libertarian Party.  For those of you who are not Libertarian,  I ask that you give us a chance to convince you that, if you want freedom in our time,  the Texas Libertarian Party is not just another choice our have, we're your only choice. </p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/8/0/highres_8081856.jpeg","8081856","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/8/0/600_8081856.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/8/0/thumb_8081856.jpeg","event","1431081","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/6/3/highres_10589027.jpeg","10589027","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/6/3/600_10589027.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/6/3/thumb_10589027.jpeg","event","29.72","https://www.meetup.com/Harris-County-Libertarian-Party-lpharris-org/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.22","742","4","13","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Harris County Libertarian Party Meetup Group","2010 and 2014 Libertarian Nominee for Texas Governor","12374167","Kathie Glass","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/6/5/1/highres_15878481.jpeg","15878481","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/6/5/1/member_15878481.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/6/5/1/thumb_15878481.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Harris-County-Libertarian-Party-lpharris-org","public_limited","Libertarians","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there are activists who attend our events and find the community valuable, we specifically do not take positions or engage as a group in political activities. We are a social group. We try to choose happy hour locations that offer a wide variety of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well as healthy food.  In addition to the Thursday happy hours, we often schedule parties, social outings, volunteer opportunities, and other fun events on weekends. All are posted on both Facebook and Meetup with RSVP's gathered from both sites.  Please join us on Facebook as well as Meetup to participate in the between-event discussions.

Bernie Sanders has always fought for the democratic rights of the 99%. He has taken on the large monopolies, the military industrial complex, and the extreme right in a consistent struggle for working families. We believe that Bernie Sanders' candidacy for president of the United States would benefit African-Americans, immigrant families, the trade union movement, environmental sustainability, women's and LGBT rights, and education. Bernie Sanders stands with all Americans and represents everyone who believes in democracy, peace, and justice. His campaign for presidency will lead towards a large alliance of the most diverse and progressive forces in this country. We need a real progressive candidate who is not all talk but has a history of following through with action. Bernie Sanders has shown over the years that he can win elections and is a viable candidate. We believe that Senator Bernie Sanders should run in the Democratic primary, not as an independent, so that he will have the best chance of winning the presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders' politics and philosophy best reflect the goals of the founding fathers of the American Revolution, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He is a candidate that can truly galvanize the vast majority of Americans in taking back our country from big corporations and restoring democracy.","","","","","","","18179026","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/highres_447735041.jpeg","447735041","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/600_447735041.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/thumb_447735041.jpeg","event","29.74","https://www.meetup.com/Houstonians-For-Bernie-Sanders/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.39","1068","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Houstonians For Bernie Sanders","249981137","May Day March & Rally","1525208400000","-18000000","1","","80107652","bernard sampson","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/highres_252133959.jpeg","252133959","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/member_252133959.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/thumb_252133959.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Houstonians-For-Bernie-Sanders","public","Progressives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

<p>The National Organization for Women, Inc. is committed to taking action to bring women into full equality in the mainstream of American society NOW. The Houston Area chapter is active in fighting for reproductive and abortion rights, pay equity, legal and social equality for women, and ending domestic violence and sexual assault. We have an active campaign to register and educate voters so we can take back our state from those who want to control our most private parts and private places.&nbsp; We also have a campaign going to educate people about ""fake clinics"" and we provide clinic escorts at a local abortion clinic to protect women from anti-abortion protesters. NOW means ACTION so if you agree with our mission and want make change, come join us at our regular monthly meetings which are usually on the first Sunday of each month and participate in our actions as they develop. You can also find out more about NOW at <a href=""http://www.now.org"">www.now.org</a> and on our chapter facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NOWHouston."">www.facebook.com/NOWHouston.</a></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Houston","US","1373313309000","<p>An informal, inclusive liberal social group. Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher. Drinking Liberally gives like minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where it's not taboo to talk politics. Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths, you feel the bond of common ground. Bring democratic discourse to your local democratic space - build democracy one drink at a time. While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't do it. --quoted from the web site at <a href=""http://livingliberally.org/drinking/about"" class=""linkified"">http://livingliberally.org/drinking/about</a></p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/highres_257543662.jpeg","257543662","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/600_257543662.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/thumb_257543662.jpeg","event","9270022","approval","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/highres_257543662.jpeg","257543662","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/600_257543662.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/thumb_257543662.jpeg","event","29.75","https://www.meetup.com/Drinking-Liberally-Houston/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.42","393","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Drinking Liberally Houston","ddlzhgyxhbdb","Come join us for our weekly get together, and drink liberally.","1525302000000","-18000000","1","Hi -  I just moved to Houston and am interested in joining your book club.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each event will be ONE hour and a HALF Saturday mornings (10:00 am to 11:30 am). There is a format for all speaking participants, however, speakers are encouraged to share a 30 min presentation at a future event about a topic of their choice, as long as it surrounds: Women's Rights initiatives and keeping in line with this group's Pro-Choice values. The mission is to create a forum that inspires mentorship, camaraderie among women/girls, research, experience in speaking in public, and civic engagement (to name a few), all of which, will leave room for Q &amp; A afterwards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The event will ALWAYS be FREE and we seek to have a talk EVERY Saturday morning starting February 21, 2015. Location details will be announced. Everyone is not expected to attend ALL events, however, there should ALWAYS be someone talking about SOMETHING each Saturday.</p>","","","","","","","18403384","approval","","","","","","","29.71","https://www.meetup.com/Womans-Rights-Forum/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.4","30","4","13","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Woman's Rights Forum","","","","","","","2360255","MMY1","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/8/a/highres_7343434.jpeg","7343434","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/8/a/member_7343434.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/b/8/a/thumb_7343434.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Womans-Rights-Forum","public_limited","Women's Rights Enthusiasts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We welcome long-time students of Objectivism as well as those who are new to her philosophy. Our goal is to discuss and learn how to apply the philosophy of Objectivism to the questions which pertain to our daily lives. We are open to political/intellectual activism, philosophical discussion, and social activities. But most of all, we want to have a good time doing it. Our goal is to have fun, meet new people, and check out cool places.<br>

We try to choose happy hour locations that offer a wide variety of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well as healthy food.  In addition to the Thursday happy hours, we often schedule parties, social outings, volunteer opportunities, and other fun events on weekends.

Bernie Sanders has always fought for the democratic rights of the 99%. He has taken on the large monopolies, the military industrial complex, and the extreme right in a consistent struggle for working families. We believe that Bernie Sanders' candidacy for president of the United States would benefit African-Americans, immigrant families, the trade union movement, environmental sustainability, women's and LGBT rights, and education. Bernie Sanders stands with all Americans and represents everyone who believes in democracy, peace, and justice. His campaign for presidency will lead towards a large alliance of the most diverse and progressive forces in this country. We need a real progressive candidate who is not all talk but has a history of following through with action. Bernie Sanders has shown over the years that he can win elections and is a viable candidate. We believe that Senator Bernie Sanders should run in the Democratic primary, not as an independent, so that he will have the best chance of winning the presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders' politics and philosophy best reflect the goals of the founding fathers of the American Revolution, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He is a candidate that can truly galvanize the vast majority of Americans in taking back our country from big corporations and restoring democracy.","","","","","","","18179026","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/highres_447735041.jpeg","447735041","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/600_447735041.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/thumb_447735041.jpeg","event","29.74","https://www.meetup.com/Houstonians-For-Bernie-Sanders/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.39","1068","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Houstonians For Bernie Sanders","249981137","May Day March & Rally","1525208400000","-18000000","1","","80107652","bernard sampson","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/highres_252133959.jpeg","252133959","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/member_252133959.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/thumb_252133959.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Houstonians-For-Bernie-Sanders","public","Progressives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

<p>The National Organization for Women, Inc. is committed to taking action to bring women into full equality in the mainstream of American society NOW. The Houston Area chapter is active in fighting for reproductive and abortion rights, pay equity, legal and social equality for women, and ending domestic violence and sexual assault. We have an active campaign to register and educate voters so we can take back our state from those who want to control our most private parts and private places.&nbsp; We also have a campaign going to educate people about ""fake clinics"" and we provide clinic escorts at a local abortion clinic to protect women from anti-abortion protesters. NOW means ACTION so if you agree with our mission and want make change, come join us at our regular monthly meetings which are usually on the first Sunday of each month and participate in our actions as they develop.

<p>We are an all&nbsp;volunteer&nbsp;local Houston organization which is part of a larger national organization. &nbsp;We will be bringing speakers in on a regular basis and devising other programs of interest to our members.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/highres_456721022.jpeg","456721022","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/600_456721022.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/thumb_456721022.jpeg","event","7644272","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/3/3/highres_450890227.jpeg","450890227","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/3/3/600_450890227.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/3/3/thumb_450890227.jpeg","event","29.76","https://www.meetup.com/Americans-United-for-Separation-of-Church-State-Houston/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.36","120","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Americans United for Separation of Church & State- Houston","","","","","","I'm long time supporter of church-state separation and other civil liberties.

Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher. Drinking Liberally gives like minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where it's not taboo to talk politics. Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths, you feel the bond of common ground. Bring democratic discourse to your local democratic space - build democracy one drink at a time. While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut.

<p>The National Organization for Women, Inc. is committed to taking action to bring women into full equality in the mainstream of American society NOW. The Houston Area chapter is active in fighting for reproductive and abortion rights, pay equity, legal and social equality for women, and ending domestic violence and sexual assault. We have an active campaign to register and educate voters so we can take back our state from those who want to control our most private parts and private places.&nbsp; We also have a campaign going to educate people about ""fake clinics"" and we provide clinic escorts at a local abortion clinic to protect women from anti-abortion protesters. NOW means ACTION so if you agree with our mission and want make change, come join us at our regular monthly meetings which are usually on the first Sunday of each month and participate in our actions as they develop. You can also find out more about NOW at <a href=""http://www.now.org"">www.now.org</a> and on our chapter facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NOWHouston."">www.facebook.com/NOWHouston.</a></p>
<p>To join the Houston Area Chapter of NOW or make a donation, go to www.NOWTexas.com or e-mail us at TexasStateNOW@gmail.com for a membership application and of course you can join at a meeting or event.&nbsp; Please join NOW thru Texas State NOW local &nbsp;rather than on the now.org website.&nbsp; Regardless of whether you join thru the national or the state organization, your dues will be joining the national, state and local NOW organizations.&nbsp; The difference is that if you join at a local meeting or &nbsp;thru Texas State NOW about 1/3 rd of the money goes to the national organization and the remainder&nbsp; stays here in Texas to help build your local and state organizations.&nbsp; When you join NOW on the national website or make a donation there, not one penny comes back to Texas.&nbsp;Later on when you renew your dues, national keeps about 2/3 rds of the&nbsp;renewal dues and&nbsp;rebates about 1/3 rd of renewal dues to the local or state organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our annual &nbsp;dues are $40 with option for reduced rates on a sliding scale. &nbsp; Your NOW dues must be current to vote on our priorities, to be a spokesperson for NOW, or to hold office in NOW.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/c/0/highres_456024000.jpeg","456024000","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/c/0/600_456024000.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/c/0/thumb_456024000.jpeg","event","12612322","approval","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/7/3/highres_454539027.jpeg","454539027","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/7/3/600_454539027.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/7/3/thumb_454539027.jpeg","event","29.76","https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Area-National-Organization-for-Women-NOW/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.36","376","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Houston Area National Organization for Women (NOW)","bwqppnyxhbrb","Houston Area NOW Monthly Meeting - Progress for Gun Sense NOW!","1525635000000","-18000000","3","One time rocket scientist, sometime lawyer, full-time feminist activist.

Come join us every other week to study classical texts in progressive thought and Marxism. Each week, we read a chapter from a book, a political pamphlet, or an essay and then carry on a collective discussion about the reading.&nbsp; Sometime we will have guest speakers.&nbsp; Our primary purpose is to increase our understanding of socialism, in both realms of theory and practice. Each week, a different person volunteers to guide us through the text, in whatever way he or she desires to do so. Everyone is welcome to attend. People from diverse political backgrounds come to our group. In the past, we have read works by Marx, Lenin, Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Marxist economists, and less well known socialist authors. Everyone is welcome to attend who has an interest in furthering the struggle for socialism.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/2/e/highres_202555342.jpeg","202555342","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/2/e/600_202555342.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/2/e/thumb_202555342.jpeg","event","7068582","approval","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/2/e/highres_202555342.jpeg","202555342","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/2/e/600_202555342.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/2/e/thumb_202555342.jpeg","event","29.75","https://www.meetup.com/The-Houston-Socialist-Reading-Group/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.35","226","4","13","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","The Houston Socialist Reading Group","249981093","May Day Rally","1525208400000","-18000000","1","","80086722","Alvaro","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/2/1/e/highres_251309214.jpeg","251309214","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/2/1/e/member_251309214.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/2/1/e/thumb_251309214.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","The-Houston-Socialist-Reading-Group","public","Socialists and Progressives","13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Houston","US","1511232926000","<p>Houston Chapter of the Centrist political movement is a gathering place for Motivated Moderates.</p>

Each week, we read a chapter from a book, a political pamphlet, or an essay and then carry on a collective discussion about the reading.&nbsp; Sometime we will have guest speakers.&nbsp; Our primary purpose is to increase our understanding of socialism, in both realms of theory and practice. Each week, a different person volunteers to guide us through the text, in whatever way he or she desires to do so. Everyone is welcome to attend. People from diverse political backgrounds come to our group. In the past, we have read works by Marx, Lenin, Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Marxist economists, and less well known socialist authors.

<p>The National Organization for Women, Inc. is committed to taking action to bring women into full equality in the mainstream of American society NOW. The Houston Area chapter is active in fighting for reproductive and abortion rights, pay equity, legal and social equality for women, and ending domestic violence and sexual assault. We have an active campaign to register and educate voters so we can take back our state from those who want to control our most private parts and private places.&nbsp; We also have a campaign going to educate people about ""fake clinics"" and we provide clinic escorts at a local abortion clinic to protect women from anti-abortion protesters. NOW means ACTION so if you agree with our mission and want make change, come join us at our regular monthly meetings which are usually on the first Sunday of each month and participate in our actions as they develop. You can also find out more about NOW at <a href=""http://www.now.org"">www.now.org</a> and on our chapter facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NOWHouston."">www.facebook.com/NOWHouston.</a></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Houston","US","1373313309000","<p>An informal, inclusive liberal social group. Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher. Drinking Liberally gives like minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where it's not taboo to talk politics. Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths, you feel the bond of common ground. Bring democratic discourse to your local democratic space - build democracy one drink at a time. While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't do it. --quoted from the web site at <a href=""http://livingliberally.org/drinking/about"" class=""linkified"">http://livingliberally.org/drinking/about</a></p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/highres_257543662.jpeg","257543662","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/600_257543662.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/thumb_257543662.jpeg","event","9270022","approval","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/highres_257543662.jpeg","257543662","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/600_257543662.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/e/thumb_257543662.jpeg","event","29.75","https://www.meetup.com/Drinking-Liberally-Houston/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.42","393","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Drinking Liberally Houston","ddlzhgyxhbdb","Come join us for our weekly get together, and drink liberally.","1525302000000","-18000000","1","Hi -  I just moved to Houston and am interested in joining your book club.

Bernie Sanders has always fought for the democratic rights of the 99%. He has taken on the large monopolies, the military industrial complex, and the extreme right in a consistent struggle for working families. We believe that Bernie Sanders' candidacy for president of the United States would benefit African-Americans, immigrant families, the trade union movement, environmental sustainability, women's and LGBT rights, and education. Bernie Sanders stands with all Americans and represents everyone who believes in democracy, peace, and justice. His campaign for presidency will lead towards a large alliance of the most diverse and progressive forces in this country. We need a real progressive candidate who is not all talk but has a history of following through with action. Bernie Sanders has shown over the years that he can win elections and is a viable candidate. We believe that Senator Bernie Sanders should run in the Democratic primary, not as an independent, so that he will have the best chance of winning the presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders' politics and philosophy best reflect the goals of the founding fathers of the American Revolution, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He is a candidate that can truly galvanize the vast majority of Americans in taking back our country from big corporations and restoring democracy.","","","","","","","18179026","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/highres_447735041.jpeg","447735041","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/600_447735041.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/c/1/thumb_447735041.jpeg","event","29.74","https://www.meetup.com/Houstonians-For-Bernie-Sanders/","USA","Houston, TX","-95.39","1068","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Houstonians For Bernie Sanders","249981137","May Day March & Rally","1525208400000","-18000000","1","","80107652","bernard sampson","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/highres_252133959.jpeg","252133959","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/member_252133959.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/8/7/thumb_252133959.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","Houstonians-For-Bernie-Sanders","public","Progressives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

<p>The National Organization for Women, Inc. is committed to taking action to bring women into full equality in the mainstream of American society NOW. The Houston Area chapter is active in fighting for reproductive and abortion rights, pay equity, legal and social equality for women, and ending domestic violence and sexual assault. We have an active campaign to register and educate voters so we can take back our state from those who want to control our most private parts and private places.&nbsp; We also have a campaign going to educate people about ""fake clinics"" and we provide clinic escorts at a local abortion clinic to protect women from anti-abortion protesters. NOW means ACTION so if you agree with our mission and want make change, come join us at our regular monthly meetings which are usually on the first Sunday of each month and participate in our actions as they develop. You can also find out more about NOW at <a href=""http://www.now.org"">www.now.org</a> and on our chapter facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NOWHouston."">www.facebook.com/NOWHouston.</a></p>

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Sealy","US","1229835096000","<p>In our society, we are inundated with information: text messages, “tweets”, commercials, sound bites, etc. Sadly, with all of this information, there is very little knowledge. Today, if you were to stop and ask someone questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What form of government do we have?</li>
<li>Can you explain the difference between the national debt and the deficit?</li>
<li>In our current monetary system, do you think it is better to have our current fiat system or was the classical gold standard better?</li>
<li>What is the role of the U.S. Constitution? The State Constitutions?</li>
<li>Does our trade deficit hurt us in the global market?</li>
<li>Can you explain the political relationship between the Federal Government and the State Governments?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will probably be met with blank stares, a shrug of the shoulders, or an “I don’t know”. Questions like these can sound hard, scary or maybe even boring but, knowing the answers to things like this are critical to understand the things that are affecting your life. They:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affect the prices you pay in the supermarket, for a car and most everything else you buy</li>
<li>Can determine how you are allowed to raise your children</li>
<li>Can affect the price of your utilities or who you are allowed to purchase from</li>
<li>And on and on…</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also critical in being able to make an informed opinion on the candidates we select to represent us in office and the legislation that is passed. In our society, politics has been boiled down to a sports like mentality. People pick either a Democrat or a Republican and then cheer their “team” in the elections. This, sadly, is the problem with the direction of our nation. People no longer seek knowledge or have political discussions beyond typical partisan talking points.</p>
<p>That is why “Wake Up And Smell The Freedom” was started. To give people an environment to openly ask questions and discuss without having to feel silly, ashamed, or embarrassed. We try to make the environment as friendly and laid back as possible and our discussions are topic driven not partisan. Many people are surprised that the answers too many of the questions above and many other questions are really not that difficult if you have just some basic understandings. So, come join us and make some great friends along the way as we journey down the path of knowledge.</p>","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/1/4/highres_140506612.jpeg","140506612","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/1/4/600_140506612.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/1/4/thumb_140506612.jpeg","event","1341271","open","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/2/2/highres_317245122.jpeg","317245122","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/2/2/600_317245122.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/2/2/thumb_317245122.jpeg","event","29.78","https://www.meetup.com/wakeupandsmellthefreedom/","USA","Sealy, TX","-96.16","77","4","13","","552","Movements","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/highres_450131941.jpeg","450131941","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/600_450131941.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/5/thumb_450131941.jpeg","event","movements","Movements","Wake Up & Smell The Freedom","","","","","","","8724421","Shelley Brian","https://secure.meetupstatic.com","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/e/9/4/highres_81044692.jpeg","81044692","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/e/9/4/member_81044692.jpeg","https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/e/9/4/thumb_81044692.jpeg","member","","","","","1.0","TX","active","US/Central","wakeupandsmellthefreedom","public","Liberty Supporters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"13","Movements & Politics","government-politics","Movements & Politics","Houston","US","1175977564000","The Houston Area Liberty Campaign was organized to promote and defend the United States of America's founding principles of individual liberty and constitutional government by means of education, political action, and community outreach. 

Apologists of the U.S. Constitution from all around the Houston area have accomplished great things from the “meetup” group formed over a year ago. We have recently established by-laws, officers, and Action Groups. Go to the Files link to view our complete by-laws. 

Our vision is to provide a variety of forums in which Liberty-Minded individuals can share ideas, participate, and socialize, all with the expressed purpose of continuing and extending the cause of Freedom and Constitutional awareness.  In addition to our regular meetings, normally held the third Saturday of each month, we host a variety of political, educational, and social events and activities.

<p>NOW, the National Organization for Women, Inc., is the oldest and largest multi-issue women's rights organization in the United States. Founded in 1966, NOW is committed to taking action to bring women into full equality in the mainstream of American society NOW. Golden Triangle NOW is organizing in the Beaumont-Port Arthur-Orange area and looking for activists to fight for reproductive and abortion rights, pay equity, legal and social equality for women, ending domestic violence and sexual assault, and ending racism and homophobia. NOW means ACTION so if you agree with our mission and want make change, join this group. NOW welcomes all who agree with our mission and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, gender, age, sexual orientation or preference, or physical disability. You can find out more about NOW and our issues at www.now.org and on facebook page at www.facebook.com/DallasNOW, www.facebook.com/TexasStateNOW; www.facebook.com/BlackFridayProtest, and www.facebook.com/StopFakeClinics</p>

<p>NOW is a civil rights action organization that fights for systemic change; not a social group or a social welfare organization. NOW is a true membership organization relying at the the state and local level in Texas entirely on volunteers to carry out our mission. In NOW our members decide our leadership and our policies and priorities. To join the Texas State Chapter of NOW or make a donation, to to www.NOWTexas.com or e-mail us at info@NOWTexas.com for a membership application. Annual dues are $40 with options for longer-term memberships, as well as reduced rates on a sliding scale. NOW is a tax exempt but not a tax deductible organization meaning that dues or donations to NOW are NOT tax deductible. While you can join NOW on the national website, we prefer that you join through Texas State NOW because that way some of your dues stay in Texas. If you join NOW or make a donation to NOW on the national website, not a penny of that comes to Texas unless and until you renew your membership at which time about third of your renewal dues, but not one cent of any donation, comes back to Texas. If you join NOW through Texas State NOW, about a third of your dues goes to national and the remainder stays in Texas. Texas State NOW is the umbrella organization for NOW operations in our state. We focus on state-wide issues and on building and supporting local organizations and actions in Texas.
