Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Creative Circle', u'urlkey': u'creativecircle', u'id': 10447}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Family Constellations', u'urlkey': u'family-constellations', u'id': 15521}, {u'name': u""Women's Circle"", u'urlkey': u'womens-circle', u'id': 17276}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Growth', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-growth', u'id': 17658}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Transformation', u'urlkey': u'transformation', u'id': 21591}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Expressive Arts', u'urlkey': u'expressive-arts', u'id': 53903}, {u'name': u'Sacred Ceremony and Ritual', u'urlkey': u'sacred-ceremony-and-ritual', u'id': 59894}, {u'name': u""Women's Support"", u'urlkey': u'womens-support', u'id': 144477}]"

Women Gone Wild Adventures,"<p><span>While we love our men and our guy friends, experiencing the outdoors with a group of women is a different game.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to the outdoors, we believe in equity, not necessarily equality. (Don't understand what we mean by that statement? Come check us out and you'll discover the true meaning!)</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in physical strength, but also the inner strength of great women.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in a caring and nurturing community, where all women are free to be themselves - safe to admit their weaknesses, safe to take on new challenges, and safe to explore the boundaries of life without men.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in fostering the independent, strong woman inside of every one of us.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in having a damn good time whether it's ""roughing it"" in a fabulous mountain house and hitting up the spa, or car camping and checking out the local hot springs, or 10-days in the backcountry without a shower.</span></p>

Santa Cruz Women Hiking,"<p>Dear fellow hikers or potential hikers,</p>
<p>I love hiking in the fresh air of mountain and sea, and want to join with other women in exploring hiking trails in Santa Cruz and neighboring counties. My goal is to get good exercise, enjoy good company, and experience the serenity and inspiration of the great outdoors.</p>
<p>Most of the hikes I will organize will be in the 3- to 7- mile range with a gain of 200 to 2000 feet. &nbsp;There are other organizers, however, who may do longer and/or more difficult hikes. If you're not ready to do the longer steeper hikes, try the easier ones! You are also welcome to come and do a portion of a hike, then return on your own. That's how I got started!</p>
<p>This group is for women of any age, who love hiking in beautiful natural spaces, or who would like to give it a try! It's also a relaxed and easy way to make new friends :)</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the group or the hikes, feel free to send me an email.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Kitty</p>
<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p>I will do my best to describe the level of difficulty of each hike, so you can decide if the hike is right for you. I'll use the descriptions below to indicate how much uphill there is. In addition to the uphill, please take into consideration how long the hike is. A hike may be described as moderately easy, but if it's 6 or 7 miles long, that distance may be too much for you at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Moderately easy</strong> = Up and down, but total elevation gain of less than 400 feet. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> = Total gain 400 to 800 feet. Lots of up and down. Can be steep stretches, but no really long steep uphill stretches. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderately difficult</strong> = Total gain greater than 800 feet. May be some really steep sections and/or very long stretches of uphill. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Outdoors', u'urlkey': u'outdoors', u'id': 15046}, {u'name': u""Women's Fitness"", u'urlkey': u'womens-fitness', u'id': 15123}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Exercise', u'urlkey': u'excercise', u'id': 25375}]"

Wicca Wimmin's Moon Ritual of Marin,"<p>Blessed Be Sister! This is a Wiccan Full Moon Ritual of Pagan Goddess Worship for women, to celebrate our femininity and nurture our souls. This Sister Circle loosely follows Starhawk's style in her book The Spiral Dance. We will call in the four directions, invoke the Goddess, join our energies and raise up the cone of power to bless the world, each other, the cauldron and ourselves. The Ritual is very inclusive and you may bring things to put on the altar, or put in the cauldron to be blessed. Bring your drums and magic tools, and anything that honors the Goddess, wimmin, and your natural yin. This is a celebration of our womanhood, free of the male dynamic, for our spirits to be strengthened in total safety, &nbsp;and our souls healed. Join and enjoy as we honor each other's natural womanhood, to consciously align our selves with Mother Nature's cycles. The Full Moon energy is for fullfillment of life, love, health and all goodness. Ritual is followed by a vegetarian pot luck.</p>

Who wants to create this success for herself so she can give back to others through love, support and her talents as well as pay it forward through knowledge, experience, and self-expression.</b></p>
<p>This group is designed to bring heart-centered business women together for networking, support, community, brainstorming, collaborating, and growth to expand this movement of women helping women to thrive together. This group is for women who are looking for something more out of life and more out of being in business.</p>
<p><i>She may describe herself as a healer, coach, holistic practitioner, consultant, speaker with a desire to do more than business as usual. She wants to make the world a better place through her gifts and offerings. This group is perfect for women who are looking for other amazing women for their inner circle of support. Who think outside the box, wants to see positive change in their own life, in their community and their business.</i></p>
<p><b>If you are a woman searching for a greater sense of yourself and know you are destined for big things, then we would love for you to join. You don't have to know how to reach your full potential or greatness - you just have to be willing and know you are destined and deserving of greatness. I created this movement as a reminder to all of us that we as women are all in this ""thing"" we call life together. No women should feel alone and unsupported in your journey. All women have a purpose and unique gifts to share with the world. We must come together as a strong force and work as a team to build unity, strength, and a space for women to feel empowered, supported and loved so each woman may truly express her uniqueness and step into her complete greatness.</b></p>

Girl Develop It San Jose,"<p>Women Developers and Programmers!<br>

 Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.</p>
<p><br>

 It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask ""stupid questions.""</p>
<p><br>

 We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>

Embodied Voice for Relationships,"<p>If you want more depth in your relationships, this is the right group for you. Whether you are in a partnership right now or you're single, come and learn how to create an even deeper level of intimacy in all the relationships in your life. This includes professional relationships, friendships, family dynamics and anything in between.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cornerstone to every relationship is communication and communication starts by using your voice to communicate your needs and desires. The problem is, most people don't know how to use their voice effectively, so even when you say exactly what you want, your partner doesn't hear you. Frustrating when that happens, isn't it? What would it be like if you could communicate your desires clearly and effectively <b>and</b>&nbsp;have your partner fulfill those desires? That is not only possible, we're here to show you how you can create this reality in your life.</p>
<p>Learning to speak from your body allows you not only to be heard - you will be felt in a way you have probably never experienced before. Learn how to use your voice to attract and keep the relationships you desire in your life. Find your authentic voice, and notice how much different it sounds than the way you currently sound when you speak. Feel the power of your own voice in a way you have yet to experience. Isn't it time for you to create the amazing relationships you have always wanted? Join us, and make these dreams a reality.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Dating and Relationships', u'urlkey': u'dating-and-relationships', u'id': 20246}, {u'name': u'Communication Skills', u'urlkey': u'communication-skills', u'id': 20923}, {u'name': u'Successful Relationships', u'urlkey': u'successful-relationships', u'id': 22480}, {u'name': u'Find your Soulmate', u'urlkey': u'find-your-soulmate', u'id': 23350}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Relationship Building', u'urlkey': u'relationship-building', u'id': 49581}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Singles', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-singles', u'id': 88655}, {u'name': u'Manifest Your Soulmate', u'urlkey': u'manifest-your-soulmate', u'id': 128089}]"
Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>

FEMININE PROSPERITY Meetup Group,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>I created this group because I have found that women thrive when they are an integral part of a loving, supportive, emotionally healthy community.</p>
<p>We've heard many spiritual teachers, and now scientists as well, telling us that we really do create our own reality. But we have been programmed from our earliest years with lies about who we are and what we are capable of doing and being. In order to reverse that programming from our parents, our schools, our media and our entire society, we need a lot of support. We need a community consisting of loving people who take 100% responsibility for their lives and challenge you to do the same. We need a clear system to follow which teaches us how to dance with the Law of Attraction in a way that really works. Through exciting, transformational events, supportive meetings and fun activities, we are committed to keeping our vibration HIGH as much of the time as possible. Feeling wonderful, laughing, loving, creating ordinary miracles attracts more of the same! Come join us on our wild joyride!</p>

Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles,"<p>Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles are for women who want a safe, shame-free space to discuss sexuality. &nbsp;We share our stories, gain strength from each other, learn about our bodies, discuss orgasm, sexual preferences, sexual styles, body image, sexual shame &amp; trauma, and heal any wounds we may have around our sexual experiences. &nbsp;We will gain insight from HomePlay exercises specifically designed to empower us as women on this transformational journey.</p>
<p>LOTUS blooms as:</p>
<p>Loving Ourselves Fully</p>
<p>Opening to Orgasm</p>
<p>Trusting Our Authentic Expressions</p>
<p>Union with Self, Beloved &amp; Divine</p>
<p>Surrendering to Satisfaction</p>
<p>In Opening the LOTUS circles we explore each one of these themes through story telling, group activities, diad work, online instruction and sex education.</p>
<p>The Lotus Flower has long been used in eastern spirituality to symbolize female sexuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Taken from</span><a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com""> mythencyclopedia.com</a></p>
<p><i>""In Asian mythology the lotus often symbolizes the female sexual organs, from which new life is born. Lotuses appear in both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Hindus refer to the god Brahma as ""lotus-born "" for he is said to have emerged from a lotus that was the navel, or center, of the universe. The lotus is also the symbol of the goddess Padma, who appears on both Hindu and Buddhist monuments as a creative force.</i></p>
<p><i>The holiness of the flower is illustrated by the legend that when the Buddha walked on the earth he left lotuses in his trail instead of footprints. One myth about the origin of Buddha relates that he first appeared floating on a lotus. According to a Japanese legend, the mother of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Nichiren.html"">Nichiren</a>&nbsp;(Lotus of the Sun) became pregnant by dreaming of sunshine on a lotus. Nichirin founded a branch of Buddhism in the 1200s. The phrase ""Om mani padme hum,"" which both Hindus and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Buddhism.html"">Buddhists</a>&nbsp;use in meditation, means ""the jewel in the lotus"" and can refer to the Buddha or to the mystical union of male and female energies"".</i></p>
<p>Opening the LOTUS as Love, Orgasm, Trust, Union &amp; Surrender encourages us as women to step into our full, authentic, freely expressed sexual selves.</p>

Mona Lisa's Smile,"Do you actually enjoy sex or want to? Are you ready to own your sexuality? Reclaim it, heal it and celebrate it? Women need a safe space in which to heal, explore, examine and learn about their sexuality. This is a group for women to talk openly and freely about women's sexuality, sexual exploration, shaking up the social norms, and ignoring social taboos. So much of our popular culture is built on the idea that sex is for men. That men are the pursuers of sex, and women are the prize to be had. That women only ""give up"" sex to men in exchange for love and commitment, and that women who give it up too easily are, at best, fools who don't know how to broker good deals for ourselves. The idea of women as the sexual gatekeepers, the natural wielders of ""no,"" is so strongly embedded in our culture that women who enthusiastically say ""yes!"" because we actually like sex are profoundly threatening.","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Human Sexuality', u'urlkey': u'human-sexuality', u'id': 17854}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Open Relationships', u'urlkey': u'open-relationships', u'id': 19785}, {u'name': u'Dating and Relationships', u'urlkey': u'dating-and-relationships', u'id': 20246}, {u'name': u'Women and Sexuality', u'urlkey': u'women-and-sexuality', u'id': 20499}, {u'name': u'Sexual Education', u'urlkey': u'sexual-education', u'id': 20591}, {u'name': u'Sensual and Erotic Education', u'urlkey': u'sensual-and-erotic-education', u'id': 20593}, {u'name': u'Bisexual Women', u'urlkey': u'bisexual-women', u'id': 21737}, {u'name': u'Alternative Lifestyles', u'urlkey': u'alternative-lifestyles', u'id': 24818}, {u'name': u""Women's Sexuality"", u'urlkey': u'womens-sexuality', u'id': 26430}, {u'name': u'Sexuality Awareness', u'urlkey': u'sexuality-awareness', u'id': 32303}, {u'name': u'Swingers', u'urlkey': u'swinger', u'id': 61474}, {u'name': u'Sensuality', u'urlkey': u'celebrate-sensuality', u'id': 93385}, {u'name': u'Sex and Sexuality', u'urlkey': u'sex-and-sexuality', u'id': 129425}]"

<p>In our culture, we are conditioned and programmed from birth with the script of the dominators of our culture. In this community we bond, grow, learn, unlearn, celebrate life. As a result of our conditioning from our society and our biological families, we act in ways and create a life that is counter to our own and our collective benefit. Through presentations, instruction, practices, video, creative expression, group exercises, healing practices, love, play, and emotion in safe created space, we will allow our spirit, our soul, our minds and our physical body to return to our essential state (to our essence) in connection to all (rather than in isolation).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we speak of personal growth we are creating a life that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - More and more Conscious<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Living a life toward Meaning<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - being Considerate of the effects our thoughts, emotions, choices and actions have on ourselves, others, the world<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Acknowledging the connection between ourselves and everything everyone and everything that appears not us<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are a group of women committed to taking an intentional journey of growth together, waking up, bonding, learning to love, making deep connection, real community, calling on one another, celebrating together and becoming a community.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Community Home is ""Demeter's Magical Sanctuary"": Healing rooms, educational center, nature retreat, holistic and spiritual lifestyle learning, community.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This community is for all those who self define as women.

We look to build someone up not tear them down. We will discuss shadow (or unhealthy patterns), but in a loving supportive manner, and we will practice healthy patterns. Personal antagonistic attack will not be tolerated. Each one teach one. Humility allows growth, defensiveness prevents it. Change is life and life is change.

Goddess Painting Class,"Paint your OWN sacred icon of the Divine Feminine, *even if you've NEVER painted before!* This class is a supportive, welcoming environment for artists and NON-artists alike to paint the Goddess in her many forms. Led by Katie Ketchum and Jennifer Mantle and based on Shiloh Sophia's Color of Woman method, we gather once a month to feed your spirit and guide you through creating a personal icon from beginning to end. The Color of Woman method was developed by Shiloh to enable you to create a painting you love without any prior knowledge or skill. Jennifer and Katie both thought they could never paint- and now not only teach but have had solo shows of their own work and routinely sell paintings! Classes take place in sacred space and begin with an opening and connecting to the Goddess we are working with that month, and then step-by-step instruction with live demo. This is a criticism-free zone. We are all about empowering and supporting each participant. Open to all, including men, GNC folks, kids, everyone. We also maintain an optional, private Facebook group that you're welcome to join upon taking a class. We would love to see you! Everything included in the class fee of $35, though if you wish to use a larger canvas than those we provide (which are typically around 9"" x 11"") and any favorite paints/brushes, feel free to do so. Kindly avoid the use of scented products.","[{u'name': u'Art', u'urlkey': u'art', u'id': 1502}, {u'name': u'Crafts', u'urlkey': u'craftswap', u'id': 10099}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'DIY (Do It Yourself)', u'urlkey': u'diy', u'id': 10438}, {u'name': u'Handmade Crafts', u'urlkey': u'handmade-crafts', u'id': 16459}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Goddesses', u'urlkey': u'goddesses', u'id': 20610}, {u'name': u'Creativity', u'urlkey': u'creative', u'id': 36229}, {u'name': u'Divine Feminine Wisdom', u'urlkey': u'divine-feminine-wisdom', u'id': 40243}, {u'name': u'Makers', u'urlkey': u'makers', u'id': 43887}, {u'name': u'Sacred Feminine', u'urlkey': u'sacred-feminine', u'id': 62062}, {u'name': u'Divine Feminine', u'urlkey': u'divine-feminine', u'id': 84775}, {u'name': u'Goddess Studies', u'urlkey': u'goddess-studies', u'id': 89391}, {u'name': u'Goddess Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'goddess-spirituality', u'id': 97136}, {u'name': u'Goddess Worship', u'urlkey': u'goddess-worship', u'id': 164227}]"

Dream Priestess(TM) Circle - Bay Area Women,"<p><span>The Dream Priestess(TM) Circle is a women's gathering where you can explore everyday magic. You will awaken and deepen your spiritual gifts (e.g. intuition), step into your spiritual power as a leader, and play with new ways of accessing spiritual guidance.</span> <br></p>
<p>Whether you're experienced with your spiritual gifts, or just discovering you have them, join us for creative exploration and fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatherings are at my home and there's room for about 10 women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

San Francisco Wine Lovers Group,"<p><span>This group is for the general public to enjoy wine and socialize. Whatever wine you like is OK here, because this group is not for the wine industry or the ""wine expert"" snobs. The organizer is not part of the wine industry and does not take money or gifts from the wine industry, e.g., no web site sponsors. Therefor, we don't promote or push any wine brands on our web site.</span></p>
<p><span>We only go to nice QUIET uncrowded venues. None of our photos are of paid professional models, just us. Our wine meetups are usually close to BART stations to make it easy for people around the Bay Area to attend.</span></p>
<p><span>This wine group puts the wine drinkers 1st, the wine 2nd, the wine industry 3rd, and the ""wine experts"" last. I have turned down all wine industry companies, about 20, offering me money to promote their services on this web site.</span></p>
<p><span>UNCORKING NEWS:&nbsp; August 10th: &nbsp;We go to the Barrel Room wine bar which recently moved to the historic building at 415 Sansome Street, San Francisco. <br></span></p>

Peninsula French Movies & More,"<p>We are a group of movie fans united by our love of current -- and classic -- French films, and more. What's the ""more?""

If you don't know the difference between the <em>Nouvelle vague&nbsp;</em>and <em>Nouvelle cuisine</em>, you're welcome! If you do know the differences, you're welcome! Whether you speak French fluently, a little, or not at all, you're welcome! All you need to join us is an interest and passion for French cinema and culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our base of operations will be the mid-Peninsula, taking advantage of the local Landmark and CineArts theaters, and extending to San Francisco and other Bay Area venues, when the programming is appropriate. Our goal is to see these movies as they were meant to be seen: On the big screen, with other fans!&nbsp;</p>

The Walnut Creek Area Dining Out & Social Group,"Hi there!

The Walnut Creek Area Dining Out Meetup is about a few things:

1. People. We're all social people who enjoy making new freinds and having a good time and that's the first goal of our meetups. 
2. Good food. Whether it be an exciting new restaurant, ethnic food, high-end or a cheap-eat, or simply an easy favorite, this group is about enjoying food.  If there's a place you love, send a suggestion and we'll get it on the schedule!
3. Expand our world - whether through food, or people or through the mere act of getting out and doing something you might not normally do, getting together with a group of new people and getting to know each other is expanding your life beyond it's current place.  
4. Fun!  Most importantly, we're here to have fun.  This is an easy, pressure free way to have a good time relax, socialize, party, indulge... it's whatever we make it.

We'll aim for Thurs/Fri/Saturday meetups, but we're also going to have weekday meetups as well.

In addition, we won't always be having full ""dinner"" meetups.  Let's be honest - some of us enjoy a good plate of nachos over a couple of beers and cocktails.

North Bay Sailing Meetup Group,"<p>It's easy to make sailing friends here! &nbsp;We are the original sailing Meetup group in the Bay Area, and the largest and most active. &nbsp;We try to offer inexpensive sailing opportunities for everyone. &nbsp; All of our events are free, unlike other groups, which exist to charge people to sail. &nbsp;The only time we charge people is when the event is a charter-share and everyone ""chips in"" on the cost to charter the boat. &nbsp;We don't believe in using the Meetup platform to run a business.</p>
<p>You don't have to know how to sail to be part of the group. &nbsp;People with boats usually always welcome guests aboard to help pull ropes and turn cranks and pass out beer. &nbsp;That is called ""crewing"".</p>
<p>The purpose of this meetup group is to promote and share the passions of sailing. Anyone interested in sailing may join. The variety of scheduled events can help build up your sailing social circle, which is one of the keys to more sailing. Educational, social, and actual sailing events will be fun and allow members to meet each other.</p>
<p>Here is a great little example of some fast sailing and what one of our events is like:&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtu.be/sZGAHo9X54E"">Click here</a></p>
<p>Hopefully we can introduce some passion-sailors to racing. It's a good way to sail more and really learn how to sail well. And it's a great excuse to go sailing on the race days, of which there are quite a lot in SF Bay. And, don't forget practice sessions, too. Crewing for race boats is the best way to get a lot of fun, inexpensive, thrilling sailing with a dedicated crew.</p>
<p><span>Please note that members with 3 ""No Show""s to events will be removed from the group.</span></p>
<p><span>If you no-show to an actual sailing event, or prevent others from sailing if you change your RSVP to no within 48 hours of a sailing event, you could be removed from the group..</span></p>
<p><span>Please update your RSVP in time so the boat owners and captains can plan accordingly. This is a little courtesy to your fellow meetup members to make planning easier and not waste limited seats on a boat.</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Sailing', u'urlkey': u'sailing', u'id': 1176}, {u'name': u'New In Town', u'urlkey': u'newintown', u'id': 1273}, {u'name': u'Social Networking', u'urlkey': u'socialnetwork', u'id': 4422}, {u'name': u'Boating', u'urlkey': u'boating', u'id': 8595}, {u'name': u'Marine Mammals', u'urlkey': u'marinemammal', u'id': 10465}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Adventure', u'urlkey': u'adventure', u'id': 15892}, {u'name': u'Whales', u'urlkey': u'whales', u'id': 68451}, {u'name': u'Marine Science', u'urlkey': u'marine-science', u'id': 113380}, {u'name': u'Cetaceans', u'urlkey': u'cetaceans', u'id': 1423062}]"

<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">- &iexcl;VIVA MI GENTE!</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC  provides ways to track down the specific classes, DJ nights and live music nights you're interested in. Just check with us periodically to find different events and/or meetups or the venues that play a lot of bachata... or a mambo ""on 2"" class. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""Where?""</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">From all over the bay area, of course. The city by the bay La Salsa Vive </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""When?""</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">We started with this site back in 2007, and in 2010 we had a boom! Since then, the scene has steadily expanded, with many new venues and studios. The old directory became difficult to use and lacked the capacity to incorporate studio classes and special events. In April 2011, I created BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC to better meet these needs. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""Why?""</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">Because I love to dance salsa... and so do you. In short all tropical and regional music will be featured here.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""Can I purchase advertising for my club/studio/salsa CD/etc. on BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC ?""</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">Many more features are planned... but that would be telling, wouldn't it. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style=""color : #000000"">""Who's in charge here?""</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""color : #000000"">DJ Jazzy Jezz is the main man who is a dedicated social dancer and salsa fanatic, dj, promoter&hellip;baby sitter&hellip;etc. </span></span></p>

Walking in San Francisco for Health and History,"<p><b><span><span>See legal disclaimer at bottom of text.</span> EVERYONE MAY NOW JOIN THE GROUP EXCEPT THOSE FEW WHO WERE BANNED. Walking or hiking. Meet other local people who are interested in walking or hiking for fitness and learning about San Francisco's history, including its movie history. This walking group is unique. It is primarily a health group with a dash of history talk for flavor. It is for people in average physical shape who need restroom stops and not for athletes or people with serious medical conditions.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>We keep our group together. We go on many different urban walks, in the best areas, that vary greatly in amounts of climbing and history facts. We walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes at a walk's end we have an optional dinner together at a fine restaurant, usually Indian, reasonably priced.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley &amp; Alameda.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. <strong><span>99 out of every 100 doctors say ""JOIN THIS GROUP!""</span></strong></span></b></p>

Oakland Pathways Volunteers,"<p><strong><span>We hope to fill Oakland's need to improve the city's many hidden pathways/stairways. At first we will remove the plant growth that is harming the pathways. Later we can do other things to improve them by such things as planting flowering plants. It is time to get local people together to improve Oakland.</span></strong></p> 
<p><span>We have already done 15 group weed cleanups which greatly improved 3 pathway/stairways in Oakland's Lakeshore Neighborhood plus one in the Upper Rockridge Neighborhood.</span></p> 
<p><span>We did our first improvement to a pathway in Oakland on Sunday, May 20, 2012, and it was a success. 3 of our group showed up to work on our first pathway which was between Balfour &amp; Calmar. Then a close neighbor we did not know saw us and joined us in removing the weeds. Our team of 4 did a great job as you may see in our photos.

<p>If you do not know your NTPR tennis skill level here are the guidelines. It will be important in helping you get situated with players of similar levels:</p>
<p>Determine your tennis rating using National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP) categories. The U.S. Tennis Association developed the NTRP rating system and it is the most accurate rating system available. Player levels are based on a scale from 1.0 to 7.0, but our divisions are based on levels from 2.0 - 5.0.</p>
<p>1.0 This player is just starting to play tennis.1.5 Has limited experience and is still working primarily on getting the ball into play.</p>
<p>2.0 Needs on-court experience. Has obvious stroke weaknesses but is familiar with basic positions for singles and doubles play.2.5 Learning to judge where the ball is going although court coverage is weak. Can sustain a short rally of slow pace with other players of the same ability.</p>
<p>3.0 Fairly consistent when hitting medium-paced shots, but is not comfortable with all strokes and lacks execution when trying for directional control, depth or power. Most common doubles formation is one-up and one-back.3.5 Has achieved improved stroke dependability with directional control on moderate shots, but still lacks depth and variety. Starting to exhibit more aggressive net play, has improved court coverage and is developing teamwork in doubles.</p>
<p>4.0 Has dependable strokes, including directional control and depth on both forehand and backhand sides on moderate shots, plus the ability to use lobs, overheads, approach shots and volleys with some success. Occasionally forces errors when serving and teamwork in doubles is evident. Rallies may be lost due to impatience.4.5 Starting to master the use of power and spins and beginning to handle pace, has sound footwork, can control depth of shots and is beginning to vary game plan according to opponents. Can hit first serves with power and accuracy and place the second serve. Tends to overhit on difficult shots. Aggressive net play is common in doubles.</p>
<p>5.0 Has good shot anticipation and frequently has an outstanding shot or exceptional consistency around which a game may be structured. Can regularly hit winners or force errors off of short balls and can put away volleys, can successfully execute lobs, drop shots, half volleys and overhead smashes and has good depth and spin on most second serves.5.5 Has developed power and/or consistency as a major weapon. Can vary strategies and styles of play in a competitive situation and hit dependable shots in a stress situation.</p>
<p>6.0 Generally do not need NTRP ratings. Rankings or past rankings will speak for themselves. The 6.0 player has obtained a sectional and /or national ranking.6.5 The 6.5 player has extensive satellite tournament experience.7.0 The 7.0 player makes his living from tournament prize money.Courtesy NTPR</p>

Sacramento Area Golfers,"<p><span>Welcome to the Sacramento Area Golfers (SAG).

The Oakland/East Bay Happy Hour,"<p><strong>Welcome to Oakland Happy Hour.</strong></p>
<p>We meet&nbsp;most Thursday evenings and&nbsp;visit a different clubs, bars and pubs, near BART, and in Oakland. Our target age range is 30's and 40's.</p>
<p>However.....</p>
<ul> 
 <p>we do also travel to other Bay Area locations in the East Bay like Berkeley and Alameda.</p> 
 <p>We sometimes have social events having nothing to do with happy hour.</p> 
 <p>We also occasionally have events on other days of the week, and</p> 
 <p>we do allow people of all ages to join.</p> 
</ul>
<p>We're kind of free flowing like that with very little structure and very few rules. This is meant to be a fun relaxed atmosphere. There are none of the following:</p>
<ul> 
 <p>No membership dues,</p> 
 <p>No name tags,</p> 
 <p>No opportunists with sales pitches,</p> 
 <p>No a person taking role with a clip board and</p> 
 <p>No giant banners or signs.</p> 
</ul>
<p>We're just there to meet and have fun. It is not necessary to arrive on time for our events; arrive when you can. We do ask that you please RSVP if you might be attending so that we can alert the bar as to how many people to expect to be there and so I can try to negotiate specials with future venues. <span><strong>Our numbers are our discounts</strong></span> and the Oakland Happy Hour is all about discounts when we can get them.</p>
<p>Please be clear, <em><b>we are not a singles meetup</b></em>. This group is about meeting new friends and having a good time. Although I do know that people have started dating after meeting in this group, <b><i>please do not come with the expectation of ""hooking-up.""</i></b> If I get enough complaints, cougars and cheese-balls will be booted.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we have no signage. Please try to look for the Organizer on your first visit. We <span>never</span> put up a sign but are always easy to find with very little effort. you just have to ask. I have found that people in this group are incredibly friendly and very easy to talk to. You just have to show up and order a drink.</p>
<p>Occasionally an organizer tip box may come out to help pay for the website maintenance. Please feel free to contribute only if you had a good time and it will not impede the purchase of your next drink.</p>

The Bay Area Sushi & Sake Aficionado Group,"<p>Meet other sushi and sake addicts in your area! We'll try different sushi places around the peninsula, attack the fish, drink up some sake, and then rattle our blah blah of what we think about the restaurant - or life in general....</p>
<p>The event limit is 15 people (occasionally more if venue capacity allows), depending on the place, we might have to sit in separate tables (hardly any sushi place can accommodate 15 people in one table). We order a few things and share with our table mates. I will split the check (whatever remaining balance beyond the prepaid fee), divide the food + tax + tips equally and clean up your wallet. Drinks will be paid separately to be fair for those who don't drink but still would like to get fishy.</p>
<p>I am taking the group on average 3-5 times a month cruising up and down from San Jose to San Francisco, coast to inland from the Peninsula to East Bay, to explore legendary sushi and sake spots, hidden gems, and unexpected findings. This is for some serious and adventurous sushi fanatics, needless to say ""California Roll"" and ""Cream Cheese"" are not in our vocabularies, although we'd welcome some eccentric blends.

Dining Galore and More in the Greater Sacramento Area,"<p>Welcome to the new merger of Dining and More and the Brunch Club to ""Dining Galore and More""</p>
<p>Catherine and I have done a joint merger of our groups and the focus has changed from just Brunch to many different and exciting events...</p>
<p>The purpose is to try different dining venues of Sacramento, Roseville, El Dorado Hills, Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, etc. All we ask is for people to have an open mind, empty stomach, and have a great time meeting others &amp; enjoying wonderful meals.</p>
<p>A couple of simple rules (no brainers, but you never know...) from Catherine and I</p>
<p>1. Pay for what you order<br>

2. Show up on time (if not, please call/email me in advance so I don't keep a party of 6 people waiting for your grand entrance)<br>

3. Please change your RSVPs accordingly (to leave room for others who would like a chance to dine out with us~no hogging the RSVPs)<br>

4. Have a great time, meet new friends</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Bring enough change for your meal and a tip</p>
<p>One last thing, if a dining venue is full &amp; you would still like to attend, please let us know so we may expand the RSVP capacity &amp; make reservations accordingly.</p>
<p>Membership fee $1.00</p>
<p>Thank you to all for making this possible &amp; we look forward to meeting everyone! Bon appetit!</p>","[{u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u""From Dining Out to BBQ's"", u'urlkey': u'from-dining-out-to-bbqs', u'id': 36717}]"

Southbay Friends: Boardgames & More,"<p>This group has many types of activities: Boardgames, Karaoke, Hikes, Dance, Theatre Outings, Sport Events, Metaphysical (Meditation, Tantric Learning, Reiki, Massage, etc.), Poker, Sharing Cooking &amp; Baking, Movie Night, Improv Night, and Anything else you suggest.</p>
<p><span><strong>Really! Suggest something!</strong></span></p>
<p>And when it comes to Board Games...I am often asked ""<strong>What kind of Games do you play?</strong>"" <br> A pretty accurate answer to ""What kind of board games do we play"" is: <br> <span><strong>""Euro-Strategy games, as found on BoardGamesGeek.com.""</strong></span></p>
<p>That is not necessarily the most helpful answer, tho.&nbsp; The actual range of games vary from super-simple (learn in 5 minutes, play in 10 minutes) to very involved (learn in 45 minutes, play in 4 hours, takes a dozen games before you really ""get it"")...So, chances are if you think to yourself ""I like playing board games""...you'll probably find someone here who likes what you like :-)</p>
<p><span><strong>***Check our Calendar!***</strong></span></p>
<p>There's so many events per month, it's the only way to know what's coming up! We're all busy professionals, normal people, who want to make the most of our time away from work. We want to do more with our evenings than just sip a drink and check out the cuties in a bar. We want to take a break from trying to hook-up and just have fun together. Since we're not focused on trying to hook-up, single people and coupled people and even N-tupled people can freely join in and we'll all enjoy greater fun.</p>
<p>Many Events are in private home venues, for a very relaxed and comfortable interaction. These events include food, drink, and always interesting people.</p>

<p><strong>What do we do at night?</strong></p>
<p>Friday/Saturday nights are for socializing &amp; getting to know other members. Friday night, the party is helped by ""Shooterville"", our donations driven bar. Saturday night, the party begins with our volunteer dinner followed by more socializing at ""Shooterville"", dancing &amp; more socializing. What if I don't ski or board? Some people come knowing how &amp; some don't. We encourage people to have fun, learn or just be a hood ornament; it's all good with us!</p>

A perfectly balanced mix of strategy and luck that generated hundreds of titles around the world. Some are official versions of the original one, others are a development of the basic concept. While this group features Risk Like, it is dedicated to promote the knowledge of all board games and to gather their fans.</p>

<p>Meet <b>weekdays and weekends</b> to walk or run 3 miles or more at various locations throughout the Bay Area. Our group is social but fitness and a healthy lifestyle are integral parts of the program. With professional coaching and sports nutrition on hand, you will be supported and can go as far as you want with your own healthy lifestyle. Minimum requirement is that you can move for 60 minutes already. The <b>pace</b> doesn't matter.</p> 
<p>Some of us walk for fitness. Some of us mix walking/running. Some of us are pretty serious runners and are training to improve our times. Most of us participate in a race once in a while. We encourage you to compete in a few races every year and help you train. Setting goals and following through makes a big difference in sticking with a fitness plan however, racing is not a requirement to join us.</p> 
<p><b>For your</b> free consult <b>with Coach Stephanie <a href=""http://gowowteam.com/scheduler"">go here</a></b></p> 
<p><b>To join us for a free workout just RSVP right here on Meetup (no payment required)</b></p>

<p><b>Recreational Runners and Runner/Walkers</b>:10-15 min/mile sometimes compete. You are competing with yourself to improve your fitness, lose weight, and race to stay focused. Many comment on the stress relief from their busy lives, too. We have many women who are in this category.</p> 
<p><b>Walkers Who Walk for Fitness</b><b>:</b> <i>""I can walk forever but would like to get more fit"".</i> Does this describe you? Want to maintain or improve general fitness?

Classic Literature and Cafes Book Club,"<p>I'm hoping to combine two things that I love: Literature and discussion about literature that takes place in a relaxed cafe atmosphere (nothing too fancy here &amp; drinking is optional). A nice way to meet other literature lovers and smart conversationalists.</p>
<p>Come and join the fun and expand your horizons a bit when it comes to literature! I need motivation at times to complete my reading list and maybe you do too? I'm a fan of classic literature (think Aeschylus, Dostoyevsky, Mann, Balzac, Cervantes, Goethe, Hardy, Faulkner) who has a special fondness for modernist and postmodernist writing (e.g., Brautigan, Broch, Breton, Celine, Kundera, Joyce, Rilke, Woolf, Zamyatin, Pynchon, Acker, Cortazar, Ellison, Pamuk, Calvino, Kluge, Garcia-Marquez).

Oakland Sailing Meetup Group,"<p>Meet Sailors, from salty souls to those who have never tried it, join us and go sailing. Our group often includes folks from our sponsors school of folks that just finished or are taking classes getting ready to enjoy this combination of sport &amp; lifestyle. Don't be fooled by the number of sailors signed up for the events. The actual number going is ofter much higher.</p>
<p>Oakland Sailing Meetup Group (OSMG) welcomes all (and kids can go, half price or free when adult attendance covers the minimum for renting the boat(s) we use).</p>
<p>We sail for the fun and love of sailing and to just practice. Our fun/practice outings include: sunset sails, casual sailing, Bay cruises, loops around an island, sail to SF city front. Try a sail to an island raft-up or a photography sailing tour of San Francisco Bay. We often enjoy great foody pot-luck BBQs either at Afterguard's site or on a raft-up of boats.</p>
<p>Want to GO SAILING - It is easy to get aboard a boat with OSMG - there are lots of boats. Our primary sponsor is a professional sailing school with a foundation arm that links to the Sea Scouts, Vets and many ages of kids plus Meetup. This is why our Meetup has access to many boats. We do pay to use the boats, but way less than the cost for privately owned yachts placed in charter.</p>
<p>Event cuts offs are set as close to the sailing event as possible. If at the last minute. turns out you can go - just call the posted numbers. Won't check email if close to ""cast off"" point. You don't want to miss the boat.</p>
<p>Members: If you have an idea for a sail or group event - email it in. This is your group too.</p>
<p>April-October 6-8:30 pm we sail every Wed. Some years we host wine or beer tasting and foodie events to follow sailing. In Nov-Mar is when there are more raft ups on weekends and other kinds of sails that follow with the many holidays.</p>
<p>Want to learn to sail? We meet at Afterguard Sailing Academy - the Bay Area's most affordable professional sailing school - the little school with heart. As a school Afterguard does specialize in setting up classes for friends, couples and families on the same boat. Sounds like 'Dah' yet many professional schools force families or couple to separate to different boats to learn. Sailing for Afterguard is a shared sport - learning how to share sailing, as a family, friend, couples, family or co-workers can help to get things done. Afterguard enjoys the reputation as the school that provides the best sailing education for your money. See the sponsor tab to learn more about Afterguard.</p>
<p>Oakland Sailing Meetup Group started in 2008. We are still sailing and loving it.</p>","[{u'name': u'Sailing', u'urlkey': u'sailing', u'id': 1176}, {u'name': u'Boating', u'urlkey': u'boating', u'id': 8595}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Outdoors', u'urlkey': u'outdoors', u'id': 15046}, {u'name': u'Fun Times', u'urlkey': u'fun-times', u'id': 15117}, {u'name': u'Adventure', u'urlkey': u'adventure', u'id': 15892}, {u'name': u'Water Sports', u'urlkey': u'water-sports', u'id': 17437}, {u'name': u'Outdoor Photography', u'urlkey': u'outdoor-photography', u'id': 39879}]"

The Indian Thing - Revamped!!,"<p>The Indian Thing!! - Is a group for women in their 20s and 30s interested in Indian Culture. In this group we will do all things fun from Indian Culture as well as rest of the world.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this group is to encourage members to share with the rest of the group what they find most interesting and would love to do it with this group - Restaurants, Cafes, Plays, Concerts, Hiking trails, Cultural festivals, all those <span>hole-in-the-wall places you love to go</span> - Just make it into an event with this group. If you need help hosting this event you can ask others to help organize it with you.</p>
<p>Come join this group if you love to meet new people and enjoy doing new things. This is a place where we can form lasting friendships and above all share a good laugh.</p>
<p>RULES, RULES, RULES: Yes we need them :)</p>
<p>The success of the group depends on the joint efforts of its members. Below are some pointers to help us achieve the same:</p>
<p>i) Please be courteous to the event planners time and efforts, if you cannot make it to the event change yours RSVP from YES to NO, ahead of time. This allows other members to join the event.</p>
<p>ii) If you have RSVPed 'YES' for an event have 3 'No Shows' in a 365 day period, you will be removed from the group. Changing the RSVP from YES to NO in last 4 hour period of the event will be considered 'No Show'.</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to come, do not hesitate to let the organizers/event host know.</p>
<p>iv) We do understand your privacy concerns but do try to post a legitimate picture on your profile, especially if you are hosting an event. This helps other members to recognize you.</p>
<p>v) New applicants who do not have profile description or photo would not be accepted to the group, it is difficult to know if you are joining this group for legitimate reasons without that information.</p>
<p><span>vi) Lastly but most importantly:</span></p>
<p>If you are organizing an event through some other sources please do not make it an event on this meetup. This meetup is only for organizing events that you want to attend with members of this group. No promotional event please. Those events will be removed.</p>

<p>We encourage people with all types of business backgrounds to join.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Weather you have a little bit or a lot of knowledge in real estate we can potentially help your investment grow.</span><span>&nbsp; We are creating groups to purchase, rehab &amp; sell properties, (fix &amp; flip) all the while using as many of our members for selected services, and ultimately divide up the profits at the close of each escrow.</span></p>
<p>By joining the group, there are no requirements to spend a dollar and invest. &nbsp;Though, please come to the somewhat occasional meeting(s) to review the opportunity at hand to see if you are interested in being part of that particular Fix &amp; Flip project. ***We do NOT hold regular meetings, only meetings to review properties that have an excellent potential to fix &amp; flip. &nbsp;All are welcome to send to the moderator a suggested property. &nbsp;Please know the asking price, estimated read costs, &amp; estimated resale value after rehab.</p>
<p>We come together to fix &amp; flip, to grow our knowledge and more importantly our investment portfolio! &nbsp;All properties are available as a Joint Venture (JV) or possibly sold to a solo investor.</p>
<p>An investment group is formed project by project.</p>

SpreadKindness.org,"<p>This group is for people who believe in practicing acts of kindness in everyday life. If we can get more people doing this then the world will become a happier place where peace and joy happen.</p>
<p>Join us as we inspire, enlighten, and make someone's day happy through sincere kindness of our hearts. Together we can make a world of difference- one person at a time. If you do one random act of kindness everyday it will put a smile on both your face and also on the face of the other person.</p>
<p>Location: This group will travel around the Bay Area to do&nbsp;acts of kindness&nbsp;for people, organizations, and individuals.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: You're likely to feel good and become addicted to practice acts of kindness everyday!</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves. &rdquo;</p>

Vallejo/Benicia Area Newcomers,"<p><span>Singles, Couples, and Families all welcome!</span></p>
<p><span>Meet your neighbors, make new friends, and discover all that this beautiful area has to offer. &nbsp;Whether you are new to the area, or you've been here a while and looking to make friends, this group is for you!</span></p>
<p><span>We try to schedule a variety of meetups, and we encourage our active members to suggest meetups as well! If you hear of anything happening nearby, please let us know! Some suggested meetups might be: local concerts/events/fairs, new restaurant openings, happy hours, children's events, walks, crafting, photo walks, geocaching, bowling, karaoke, biking, movie night, beer/wine tasting, dinner parties, holiday parties, picnics, etc. What do YOU like to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Looking forward to meeting you all!</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any questions, concerns, comments or suggestions or just want to talk with me, give me a call or text at 707-567-8779.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, welcome to the Vallejo/Benicia area and to our group!<br><br></span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely, Scott and the Vallejo/Benicia Area Newcomers Organizers (VBAN) and Hosts</span></p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p><span>Membership dues are just $5 per year, to cover the fees that Meetup charges us, as well as any additional expenses such as fliers, signs, etc. If you have any trouble with paying online through Meetup, please contact me to arrange an alternate method. The dues for now are voluntary but I hope you'd like to contribute as the cost to meetup.com is almost $200 per year for the organizer and if there is some extra (there hasn't been as of yet) we'd like to put that toward events for those in need or those without perhaps, or maybe advertising or party accessories or games perhaps for the group events/activities.<br> </span></p>
<p><span>If you want to suggest/host a meetup, please follow these guidelines:</span></p>
<p>- You must be an ACTIVE member, and have attended at least TWO events where at least one of the regular VBAN organizers also attended, and we've had a chance to get to know you. This is to ensure everyone's continued FUN and SAFETY! As a general rule, it is not a good idea to email people from the group without their permission, and especially don't make others uncomfortable. Please share your real name (first only is ok) and share a picture of you (not just your animals or a sunset for example) in your profile so we can all have a deeper level of safety. Thank you for your understanding!</p>
<p>- If your suggested event is approved (usually they are!), it will be announced as an official meetup and the rest of the group will automatically be notified. Usually the only reason it would not be approved is if we don't know you yet, or the event conflicts with another proposed event. Again, thank you for your understanding!</p>
<p><span>- This particular group has a lot of people who are new to the area, and quite often are new to the whole ""meetup"" concept itself. So, in your meetup description, state clearly, where and when you will meet, how long you will be in the meeting spot, and how they can find you. Try to think of questions a new person might have, and include that information in your description.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not wish to host the event, and you are just letting people know about something interesting that is happening, include ""No-host event"" in the title.</span></p>
<p><span>- If you ARE hosting an event, please bring a ""meetup"" sign with you that is large enough to be seen clearly, and display it or hold it so that new members can find you easily. You can ""google"" the word ""meetup"" and print out the logo. Usually a half-sheet of cardstock, with the logo printed on the bottom half is good. You can then fold it in half and it will stand up by itself on a table.</span></p>
<p><span>See you soon!</span></p>

SF Bay Sailing Meetup Group,"<p>A place for Skippers and Crew to ""Meetup"" and share a safe, enjoyable day on the water while practicing sailing skills and learning more about boats, sailing and the sea.</p>
<p>And, of course, we are the newest, classiest and best looking sailing meetup group in the Bay Area. ;-)</p>
<p>If you have taken a small boat sailing or basic keel-boat class and would like to get some experience actually working a sailboat on the Bay, then this Meetup group is for you. Don't be offended by being called a Newbie, sharing our love of sailing is what we enjoy most.</p>
<p>While it should not need to be said, please know that everyone is welcome here. Being chosen for an event is completely based on order of sign-up and confirmation. <br></p>
<p>When you sign up for an event, you must be serious about attending. You may not sign up as ""something that you might like to do"" and then decide at the last minute that you would rather do something else. With other Meetup groups this might be totally acceptable. But here if you take a spot, that someone else would have gladly filled, and don't show up, you have deprived someone else of the opportunity to enjoy a day on the Bay - so you will be removed from the group (even if you have paid for the event).</p>
<p>Oh, and if you act creepy, or make other members uncomfortable, you are out, period. No appeal. If you feel that someone is acting inappropriately, please let me (or Meetup) know.</p>
<p>Yes, we charge for most events. If you think that we make a profit, you are bad at math. The small donations towards expenses that you make do not come close to paying the substantial costs involves in operating and maintaining the boats, but they certainly help and they make doing what we do possible. If you bail on an event at the last minute please do not expect a refund, unless we are able to fill your seat.</p>
<p>Always answer the contact information questions when you sign up or you will not be considered and we cannot confirm your reservation.</p>
<p>Lastly, please keep coming back to the site to check and see if you have been selected to attend. If you have been selected you will receive further information on who, what, when and where. But if you have not been selected, you will not be contacted at all. It would be great if we could do this, but it is everything that we can do just to organize the event and keep the attendees informed. Thank you for your understanding on this one.</p>
<p><i>Notice: Please be aware that while the State of California may view possession of Marijuana as legal, the United States Government and the U.S. Coast Guard does not. You may not bring marijuana (or any other illegal drugs) onto our vessels. This is not debatable.</i> <br></p>
<p>Be assured that the Captains that participate in this Meetup Group are Licensed by the United States Coast Guard which involves extensive training and many years of experience. The boats are well maintained and equipped and we all carry commercial insurance. This is very different than all the other groups who do not have licensed Captains, nor the proper insurance (although many of these people do describe themselves as ""Captains""). If anyone asks you for money to attend a sailing event, ask to see their USCG Captain's license.</p>
<p>We put an emphasis on safety here, but we do want you to have an enjoyable time as well. So, please do understand that we will ask you to wear a life jacket (they are brand new and comfortable), but do come ready to have a great time. Thank you. <br></p>

<p>Feel free to post last minute messages like: ""I have the day or evening off today and would like to see ""_________ (fill in the movie title)____"" or simply offer ""Does anybody want to join me for a movie at or in ""_____(name a specific theatre or city)___"" today?</p>

<p><span>Here's a little about the theatre company whom I have worked with for over 20 years - California Theatre Center (CTC) in Sunnyvale:</span></p>
<p>I served as a company member and Marketing Director here for over 17 years. CTC is a professional, not-for-profit, repertory theatre based at The Sunnyvale Theatre... the company employs a talented and versatile, full-time acting company which performs a rich repertory of hour-long plays for Young Audiences during the traditional school year (all over the West Coast!) and full-length plays for adults and families (CTC Summer Rep) at the The Sunnyvale Community Center on Remington Drive during June and July.</p>
<p>CTC has toured all over the world and has won numerous awards and honors. I got to travel and perform in Fiji, New Zealand and The Cook Islands with CTC! The company also offers an outstanding Education program for children of all ages in several South Bay locations taught by the professional actors in the company. <a href=""http://www.ctcinc.org"">www.ctcinc.org</a></p>","[{u'name': u'Watching Movies', u'urlkey': u'movies', u'id': 1201}, {u'name': u'New In Town', u'urlkey': u'newintown', u'id': 1273}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Film', u'urlkey': u'film', u'id': 15029}, {u'name': u'Fun Times', u'urlkey': u'fun-times', u'id': 15117}, {u'name': u'Dinner and a Movie', u'urlkey': u'dinner-and-a-movie', u'id': 23778}, {u'name': u'Movies in Movie Theaters', u'urlkey': u'movies-in-movie-theaters', u'id': 43390}]"
!The Good Life!............... for people 30ish to 50ish,"<p><strong>We are a social group of people, mostly 30ish to 50ish, who want to, and realize, we live <i>The Good Life!</i></strong></p>
<p>Most events are social in nature. We are open to singles, couples, and in between. We will do activities such as mingling over wine or cocktails and are focused on making friends, or things like dancing, hikes, movies, concerts, lunches, picnics,&nbsp;street fairs, community service projects, workshops, etc. We want to attract people with good social skills that are fun and friendly, young at heart, active, easy going, and adventurous for events in the South Bay, Peninsula, and Greater Bay Area. <br> <br><b> So, if you want to live <i>The Good Life</i>, make more friends, and do fun activities, come join us!!!</b> <br> <br> In trying to keep it fun and friendly, as organizer, I'm very protective of the overall group atmosphere. So, here's a short list of people that should skip our group. <br> 1. Creepy men that are too touchy with women they have just met. <br> 2.&nbsp;<span>People who don't get the concept of friends, and instead are stalkers, players or drama queens.</span> <br> 3. Party crashers, who crash closed RSVP parties making it too crowded. <br> 4. People not interested in friendships, who join just to send spam about their book, band, Amway, etc. <br> <br> All these people get deleted from the group fast.</p>","[{u'name': u'Singles', u'urlkey': u'singles', u'id': 498}, {u'name': u'Wine', u'urlkey': u'wine', u'id': 611}, {u'name': u'Nightlife', u'urlkey': u'nightlife', u'id': 4392}, {u'name': u'Social Networking', u'urlkey': u'socialnetwork', u'id': 4422}, {u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Fun Times', u'urlkey': u'fun-times', u'id': 15117}, {u'name': u'Adventure', u'urlkey': u'adventure', u'id': 15892}, {u'name': u'Happy Hour', u'urlkey': u'happy-hours', u'id': 16800}, {u'name': u""20's & 30's Social"", u'urlkey': u'20s-30s-social', u'id': 17201}, {u'name': u'Dancing', u'urlkey': u'dancing', u'id': 17571}, {u'name': u'Singles 20s 30s 40s', u'urlkey': u'singles-20s-30s-40s', u'id': 36957}, {u'name': u'Young Professional Singles', u'urlkey': u'young-professional-singles', u'id': 58259}, {u'name': u'Short hikes', u'urlkey': u'short-hikes', u'id': 125060}]"
Mensa / San Francisco Region,"<p>This MeetUp provides a dynamic way for members of San Francisco Regional Mensa to get the latest on Mensa events in the Bay Area and to more easily host their own Mensa events. The idea is that by eliminating the very long lead time now necessary to post things to the Intelligencer, we will have more, and more varied, events on the calendar.</p>
<p>You <b>MUST </b>be a <b>*current*</b> member of Mensa to join this group. When you click ""Join Us"" (above right), please include your full name AND your Mensa membership number so that we can verify your membership.</p>
<p>If you'd like to become a member of Mensa, please go to the SFRM website, <a href=""http://www.sfmensa.org/"">http://www.sfmensa.org/</a>, to find out how to qualify, or to locate a testing session near you.</p>
<p><b>Organizers and Event Organizers can post events directly to our Meetup site, but Meetup no longer allows non-organizers to post events directly.</b></p>

BAMBAS -  Bay Area Merengue Bachata Afrocuban Salsa Club,"<p>We get together on a regular basis to go social dancing as a group.</p>

<p>The goal is to enjoy as a social activity in a friendly, supportive, social, non-competitive environment. This group is geared for beginners and people who don't take dancing (or themselves) too seriously.</p>
<p>Making mistakes and not dancing perfectly on the beat is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a beginner is okay.&nbsp; We are not snobs.&nbsp; We want to make going to dance clubs an enjoyable, friendly, social, and personal experience -- not a dance off or a showcase for one's greatness or an exercise in&nbsp;competitive social gamesmanship.</p>

<p>We only have 4 requirements.</p>
<p>1. You MUST RSVP whether you will attend the event or not.</p>

Seek to understand rather than persuade <br> . Invite and honor diversity of opinion <br> . Speak what has personal heart and meaning <br> . Go for honesty and depth without going on and on</p>

<p>Friends make life worth living and who among us couldn't use a few more? As Carrie Bradshaw once said ""life doesn't always turn out to be your fantasy......that's why you need friendships that are real......to get you through it all....""</p>

Happy Hour Club,"<p>Do you like good beer ? Do you appreciate a decent cocktail ? Do you like relaxing after a stressful week day with a chilled out, friendly, crowd ? Do you hate paying full price fer your booze ?</p>
<p>If so then Happy Hour Club for you. Every couple of weeks or so we'll meet up at a different bar in San Francisco, for a drink or two after work. Usually we'll try and hit up a good happy hour to get the most from our recession hit bucks. Though it's more about the socializing than the drinking. To find us look for a meet-up sign.</p>
<p>As always these events are dependent on getting enough people coming to make it worth my while.

Ladies Meet over a Meal,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>There are so many of us out here in the San Francisco and Bay Area; we all have different interests, different backgrounds and skills, as well as different preferences in what we eat.  Since I love eating and figure many others do too, I thought it would be fun to use the lunch hours to bring us all together.  Whether you want to try new restaurants, meet some new, exciting, and different people, or simply just build your connections... I invite you to join us for some of our lunches.  Most lunches would be in restaurants around the downtown, north beach, and financial district area during the weekdays.  Right now, I am looking into Fridays, but feel free to give me suggestions of restaurants or days that may work better for you. <br />Look forward to meeting many of you!</p>

The Roseville Women's Book Club,"<p><span>Welcome to The Roseville Women's Book Club! We are a group of women (all ages are welcome!) that get together to discuss books! It's that simple! We are a very casual and informal book club, meaning that it's just very relaxed. There is no set outline for our meetings, we just talk! We laugh a lot and have fun! Our meetings usually last about 30 minutes to an hour, but the meeting can go longer for those members who continue to hang out and just talk. We also host events that have nothing to do with books at all! Movies, lunch, theater! We hope that members can build some really great friendships through the group so we try and do a non-book related event every month. To get a better idea of what we're about, please take a moment to read the About Us page (located in the ""Pages"" tab), where you will find more information about how the group operates, a list of books that we have read, and a list of other fun events that we have done.</span></p>
<p>***Disclaimer*** The Roseville Women's Book Club is a casual, informal book club. I usually do not bring discussion questions to the meetings, but members are welcome to bring them if they like. Our meetings are a mixture of discussing the book and socializing with one another. Some discussions/meetings last longer than others and are always intermixed with off topic, social conversation. If you are seeking a more formal book club, with lengthy, in depth, serious discussions, this may not be the book club for you. If you're looking for a book club that is less intimidating and more casual in discussion, then we may be the perfect fit. If you're not sure, please join and try us out.</p>

<p>This group is for young professionals around their Mid 20's to Mid 30's. I'd love to have people who are entrepreneurial at heart and want to meet others who are just passionate about their work as they are about their social life. We'll do more than just meet at social gatherings. I'd also like to setup events in where we can expand our professional network and attend interesting lectures and conferences on topics of interest, whether it's global warming, Web 2.0, micro financing, or the latest art scene to hit the streets, I'd like this to be an eclectic group of people.</p>

<p>Come join this group if you love to meet new people and enjoy doing new things. This is a place where we can form lasting friendships and above all share a good laugh.</p>
<p>RULES, RULES, RULES: Yes we need them :)</p>
<p>The success of the group depends on the joint efforts of its members. Below are some pointers to help us achieve the same:</p>
<p>i) Please be courteous to the event planners time and efforts, if you cannot make it to the event change yours RSVP from YES to NO, ahead of time. This allows other members to join the event.</p>
<p>ii) If you have RSVPed 'YES' for an event have 3 'No Shows' in a 365 day period, you will be removed from the group. Changing the RSVP from YES to NO in last 4 hour period of the event will be considered 'No Show'.</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to come, do not hesitate to let the organizers/event host know.</p>
<p>iv) We do understand your privacy concerns but do try to post a legitimate picture on your profile, especially if you are hosting an event. This helps other members to recognize you.</p>
<p>v) New applicants who do not have profile description or photo would not be accepted to the group, it is difficult to know if you are joining this group for legitimate reasons without that information.</p>
<p><span>vi) Lastly but most importantly:</span></p>
<p>If you are organizing an event through some other sources please do not make it an event on this meetup. This meetup is only for organizing events that you want to attend with members of this group. No promotional event please. Those events will be removed.</p>

Sisters In Arms - Single Moms,"<p>Are you a single mom or pregnant and single?</p>
<p>Join us as we share the joys and struggles of single motherhood!</p>
<p>Single moms have to do it all -- we have to be both the mother AND the father, the nurturer and disciplinarian, teacher, friend and provider. Sometimes, it's hard not to look around at the couples with or without kids and feel like no one understands what you are going through.</p>
<p>Sisters In Arms - Single Moms is a social/support networking community for ""solo moms"" to meet and form close connections with other moms in similar situations. This group encourages social and professional networking, and the sharing/exchange of ideas, tips and experiences with others who understand (and may actually be experiencing many of the same issues as you) in a compassionate, empowering atmosphere. Through our meetups, informal gatherings and friendly discussions, we address ALL topics pertaining to single motherhood (such as child support, raising children of all ages, first-time moms, pregnancy, dating/intimacy and co-parenting with exes, to name a few) -- no topic is EVER taboo! We pride ourselves on the fact that our community is full of supportive, non-judgmental ""Sisters"" who are there for you when you need someone to vent your frustrations to...</p>
<p>As Sisters In Arms, our main goal is to support one another and share in the laughter and fun that may have fallen to the wayside while we were focusing on being ""Super Mom."" We encourage those who may be feeling alone on their journey to attend one of our meetups -- we guarantee that you will walk away from the event with some new found friends!</p>
<p>We have several meetups* and outings scheduled each month, so please check our site/calendar regularly for event details. Although we are primarily based in the South Bay, we do try to schedule meetups all around the Bay Area, to accommodate the locational diversity of our community.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining our group, please read our ""About Us"" page to learn more, and to familiarize yourself with our group policies.</p>
<p>*The majority of our meetups are child and ""framily"" (female friends or family) members friendly.

!The Good Life!............... for people 30ish to 50ish,"<p><strong>We are a social group of people, mostly 30ish to 50ish, who want to, and realize, we live <i>The Good Life!</i></strong></p>
<p>Most events are social in nature. We are open to singles, couples, and in between. We will do activities such as mingling over wine or cocktails and are focused on making friends, or things like dancing, hikes, movies, concerts, lunches, picnics,&nbsp;street fairs, community service projects, workshops, etc. We want to attract people with good social skills that are fun and friendly, young at heart, active, easy going, and adventurous for events in the South Bay, Peninsula, and Greater Bay Area. <br> <br><b> So, if you want to live <i>The Good Life</i>, make more friends, and do fun activities, come join us!!!</b> <br> <br> In trying to keep it fun and friendly, as organizer, I'm very protective of the overall group atmosphere. So, here's a short list of people that should skip our group. <br> 1. Creepy men that are too touchy with women they have just met. <br> 2.&nbsp;<span>People who don't get the concept of friends, and instead are stalkers, players or drama queens.</span> <br> 3. Party crashers, who crash closed RSVP parties making it too crowded. <br> 4. People not interested in friendships, who join just to send spam about their book, band, Amway, etc. <br> <br> All these people get deleted from the group fast.</p>","[{u'name': u'Singles', u'urlkey': u'singles', u'id': 498}, {u'name': u'Wine', u'urlkey': u'wine', u'id': 611}, {u'name': u'Nightlife', u'urlkey': u'nightlife', u'id': 4392}, {u'name': u'Social Networking', u'urlkey': u'socialnetwork', u'id': 4422}, {u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Fun Times', u'urlkey': u'fun-times', u'id': 15117}, {u'name': u'Adventure', u'urlkey': u'adventure', u'id': 15892}, {u'name': u'Happy Hour', u'urlkey': u'happy-hours', u'id': 16800}, {u'name': u""20's & 30's Social"", u'urlkey': u'20s-30s-social', u'id': 17201}, {u'name': u'Dancing', u'urlkey': u'dancing', u'id': 17571}, {u'name': u'Singles 20s 30s 40s', u'urlkey': u'singles-20s-30s-40s', u'id': 36957}, {u'name': u'Young Professional Singles', u'urlkey': u'young-professional-singles', u'id': 58259}, {u'name': u'Short hikes', u'urlkey': u'short-hikes', u'id': 125060}]"

"I am Happy Project - Roseville, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.</p>

Milpitas Social Group (MSG),"<p><span><strong>First and foremost,&nbsp;we wanted to create a place where everyone in the <span>Bay Area</span> can meet and make new friends doing something fun.</strong></span> <span><strong> <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>This group is for all ages over 18!!!</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE DO?</strong> We do things around the Bay Area (from <span>San Francisco</span> to Santa Barbara):</p>
<ul> 
 <p><strong>We eat:</strong> dinners, pot lucks, happy hours, parties with food</p> 
 <p><strong>We have fun</strong>:&nbsp;zip lines, paddle boats, beach parties, camping, treat yourself to a massage/spa treatment, holiday parties, monopoly board games, social dances</p> 
 <p><strong>We get fit:</strong> hiking, walking, dancing</p> 
 <p><strong>We improve our relationship potentials:</strong> dating games, meeting new people, practicing our flirting skills, figuring out what we want in potential mates, learning how to attract the right people</p> 
</ul>
<p>We want this group to be a positive and safe place where you can explore your interests and potentials&nbsp;with confidence. For this reason, we are selective. We are only looking for people of high quality: people who are respectful and courteous of others,&nbsp;people who are committed to learning and growing, people who are open-minded and&nbsp;friendly (afterall, socializing means getting along with others, among other things.)</p>
<p><strong>IS THIS GROUP RIGHT FOR ME?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes, if you are:</p>
<ul> 
 <p><strong>Just broke up with a boyfriend/girlfriend?</strong> Well join the group! Struggling with Divorce? Meet other people who are also in the midst of divorce, custody, or support-related issues and need some direction.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tired of the online dating scenes</strong> where you soon realized that&nbsp;eternal texting, chatting, and emailing cannot compare to a real human experience where you actually spend time doing something with someone? Well, we have live and real-time interacting here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Newly singled and are yet unsure what you want to do with your life?</strong> We suggest an experimental period of staying single where you can try a variety of new things, make new friends, gain new attitudes etc... You just need to find what is really right for YOU!</p> 
 <p><strong>Interested in making yourself attractive to potential mates?</strong> Your first mission&nbsp;should be to figure out what makes&nbsp;you happy as a single person and learning to enjoy life to its fullest extent while making plenty of friends out there on the trails, at the dinner parties or our other fun events.</p> 
 <p><strong>Wanting to get out of a rut?</strong> If you picture yourself as always being alone, miserable or whatever then your subconscious will see to it that you do things to keep you that way. BUT,&nbsp;if you can visualize yourself as having fun, being with other people and happier, then your subconscious will work to make positive things happen helping to boost your confidence, increase your potential, and making you the fun, interesting and attractive person that you were meant to be.</p> 
</ul>
<p><span><strong><em>Remember</em>, ""b<em>ecause you are alive, everything is possible!</em>""</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Thich Nhat Hanh</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>DO IT NOW!</strong></span> By signing up, you are telling yourself that there is absolutely no need to be miserable. As most people spend more time planning a weekend than they do planning the rest of their life, you can go against the norm and plan for the rest of your life by spending your weekends with us!</p>

One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Creative Circle', u'urlkey': u'creativecircle', u'id': 10447}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Family Constellations', u'urlkey': u'family-constellations', u'id': 15521}, {u'name': u""Women's Circle"", u'urlkey': u'womens-circle', u'id': 17276}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Growth', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-growth', u'id': 17658}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Transformation', u'urlkey': u'transformation', u'id': 21591}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Expressive Arts', u'urlkey': u'expressive-arts', u'id': 53903}, {u'name': u'Sacred Ceremony and Ritual', u'urlkey': u'sacred-ceremony-and-ritual', u'id': 59894}, {u'name': u""Women's Support"", u'urlkey': u'womens-support', u'id': 144477}]"

Open Space Appreciation Hiking Enthusiasts,"<p>I decided to start this group because we have some really awesome and fun hiking trails in our area. And also, some of these agencies have docents that really rock. The Open Space Authority docents are friendly, engaging and won't make you cry hiking up the hill (unless you like killer hikes and then they have some crazy intense hikers, too). This group is for anyone who likes to go hiking, or for walks and would like people to go with. If you like walking with other people, if you are shy, friendly, outgoing, or just love being outdoors, this is a chance to hang out with some fun people.</p>
<p>I work for the Open Space Authority and we preserve land for wildlife and people alike. If you want to know more, please check out the web site at www.openspaceauthority.org. This meetup is not actually sponsored by Open Space Authority but will include all kinds of info on their latest hikes since I am in the know. I want you to be in the know too!

Santa Rosa Women Over 45 Group,"<p> <br> <span>I imagine most of us are going through big transitions in our lives. We can learn from each other, find support and just have fun.

Sometimes it is difficult to find meaningful friendships and everyone in our group is looking for the same thing! <br></span></p>

Women in Tech - SF Bay Area,"<p>A community of women in technology where we talk tech in a non-judgemental friendly environment.</p>

<p>Please don't feel you have to be an expert on that topic or for that matter know anything about it. If you are just interested in knowing more about it this is the place for you. We are all Super Women in our fields and it would be interesting to know about other things, as simple as that.</p>
<p>If you are working a project and would need help in technology or other aspects of project development you can ask for advice and get feedback from members of our group. We can have special meetups for those kind of activities.</p>

Midtown Readers,"<p>**If your trial period ended, you were automatically removed from the meetup group. Please feel free to join again!!**</p>
<p><span>Midtown Readers is a book club for women of all ages (sorry, guys!) who seek friendships and share a love of reading a wide range of books. </span><span>Jesa and Rachel have been the organizers since August of 2013 with the intention of making Midtown Readers a space for friendships,&nbsp; community, and intelligent discussion. If you are looking for other spirited women to have thoughtful discussions with, look no further! This is a very friendly group, and new members are always welcome (we do sometimes stray outside the book--just a warning!).</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past year or so, Midtown Readers has grown into a social group that meets three times a month to discuss books (Midtown Readers), watch documentaries (Documentary Night), and make stuff (Midtown Makers). Some of us also meet as part of the Women's March movement (<a href=""https://www.womensmarch.com/100/action2/"">Huddle</a>).&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><b>Midtown Readers </b>meets the 1st Thursday of each month at a coffee shop, restaurant, wine bar, or private residence in (or fairly close to) Midtown. We poll members and ask that they select 3 or 4 books from the poll, and schedule books a few months in advance. Book selections for the polls are taken from members' comments. If you make suggestions after the poll, we'll add it to the next one. Ideal selections are books under 450 pages, and also available in paperback, e-book, and audiobook formats.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>If anyone has a suggestion for a location (preferably not too loud with ample seating), or would like to host, feel free to post in the comments of that event.&nbsp;Also, if you aren't able to finish the book, and don't mind spoilers, come anyway! </p>
<p><b>Midtown Makers </b>is hosted by on the 3rd Thursday at Tupelo. We've got members who knit, quilt, color, bullet journal, crochet, hand spin, sew...basically, if it's portable, bring it. Newbies and experienced makers are welcome! We have members who do most of the above and we are happy to teach if you'd like to learn. Send Rachel a message if you need supplies to borrow for the night. <br></p>
<p><span><b>Movie Nights </b>are hosted in various members' homes on the 4th Thursday, where we watch a documentary (or something topical), drink wine and eat snacks while watching and discussing the movie. This is generally on the 4th Thursday of the month, unless our host needs to make a change.</span></p>
<p><span>As of April 2016, we're asking members to pay $10 per billing cycle (6-months). New members have the option of trying Midtown Readers for two months and paying $10 if they like the group and want to join after that ""trial"" period.&nbsp; We pay up to $180 in Meetup fees yearly, and if we find that $10 (minus fees) covers us for a full year or more, we will adjust the payment plan. Currently, excess funds will be donated to WEAVE and Sacramento Library Adult Literacy Program by the next billing cycle (August). If you have concerns, please feel free to message us about them.&nbsp; <br></span></p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you soon! <br></p>

Social Fluency,"<p>My name is Barbara Hyman, and I'm an author, teacher, and healer. I've been on the Spiritual Path for awhile, by virtue of my advanced age. (Pushing 60!). That makes me sound a lot older than I feel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what I teach about, and what my upcoming book, Deliberate Trust, A Guide to Intentional Manifestation is all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when you're speaking about communication, in my book, you're speaking about love.&nbsp;</p>

"I am happy project - Davis, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

Ultimate Football Walnut Creek (UFWC),"<p>We've&nbsp;been playing UF&nbsp;since&nbsp;November 1st,&nbsp;2009 and recently completed our&nbsp;500th game.&nbsp; UF is a team oriented, competitive and fast paced game for adults and older kids.

<p> UF is not a league; there is no commitment&nbsp;to play.&nbsp; If you decide to play, you simply confirm when you can and then show up.&nbsp; It's a great workout and a fun time with friends. Sportsmanship, teamwork and fair play are the most critical components of UF and a must for anyone who decides to compete.&nbsp; We have a code of conduct and we're serious about it. </p>
<p>For night games, we charge $5 to cover the fees for the lights and any additional money goes to our charitable efforts.&nbsp; Once a month, we'll have a GRATEFUL GAME where players are asked to contribut $5 each for charity.</p>
<p> In 2014, we raised&nbsp;just over&nbsp;$7,100 to help the Lazarex Cancer Foundation (<a href=""http://www.lazarex.org"">www.lazarex.org</a>).&nbsp; That money was raised through optional player donations.&nbsp; In 2015, we raised $2,500 and provided 112 ($5,000) worth of microloans across the world through <a href=""http://www.kiva.org"">www.kiva.org</a>.&nbsp; In 2016, we donated $2,750 to the City of Hope, $3,000 to Heifer International (6 cows), $875 to a local science teacher, $875 to Contra Costa Group Homes and $875 to Groceries for Seniors in San Francisco.&nbsp; In 2017 we have devoted over $4,300 to one of our own struggling with a serious illness.&nbsp; In 2018.....</p>

Sacramento Sea Kayakers,"<p><span><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We Do:</strong></span></p>
<p>Sacramento Sea Kayakers is a&nbsp;<span><strong>non-profit organization&nbsp;that is organized collectively by its members.</strong></span> Members range from beginners to professionals, and own all types of paddling craft. We paddle all types of bodies of water including lakes, rivers, bays, and ocean. Recreational kayaks and entry level skills are sufficient for many of the club's events, but some events necessitate specific skills and equipment. Our paddles offer lots of fun practice opportunities for ""new to paddling"" and intermediate flat water paddlers. Motivated kayakers will find ample opportunities to ramp up their skills through our skill clinics and advanced paddles, <span>which when combined with some formal training, and lots of fun practice will help paddlers transition into being comfortable on the bay and ocean.</span></p>
<p><span>All dues and fees received are used to pay for things as determined by the Members, such as free or reduced camping, meals, skills clinics, classes and parties, etc.</span> We avoid commercial or political interests, but&nbsp;to enhance the sport of kayaking we do&nbsp;make some exceptions.</p>
<p><strong><span>Mission Statement:</span></strong></p>
<p>Sacramento Sea Kayakers Paddling Club (SSKPC / SSK) promotes kayaking in a safe and responsible manner, while making new friendships with a common interest. We kayak year round and encourage paddlers to expand their skills through training with professional&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.americancanoe.org/"">ACA</a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bcu.org.uk/"">BCU</a> instructors, and joining us on our paddles to practice and refine those skills.</p>
<p><span><strong>Monthly Public Meetings:</strong></span></p>
<p>The club has Monthly Educational Meetings that are open to the public. These usually occur the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 6p.m. at a location posted on the Meet-up site. These meetings provide great opportunities for paddlers (club members and the public alike) to socialize and learn more about kayaking. These meetings are also a great way for new and prospective members to learn about the club and meet other members.</p>
<p><span><strong>Joining Sacramento Sea Kayakers:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Membership Requirements</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Membership is open to anyone. &nbsp;We have no secret hand shakes or initiation protocols but to participate in our paddles, membership is required, and becoming a member is pretty easy to do. &nbsp;When you click the ""Join Us!"" button</span> <span>to join our group,</span> <strong>PLEASE enter your&nbsp;FIRST NAME and the initial letter of your LAST NAME.</strong></span> <span><span>We are real people, who do real things, and have real friendships, so we use our real names. &nbsp;We also want to be able to recognize you, and you us, so our second basic r</span></span><span><span>equirement for membership is a recognizable picture of you.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Third, when you join us on a paddle all paddlers fill out an emergancy contact and waiver form.<a href=""http://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/o39ua5b8fqOA"">.</a></span></p>
<p>The fourth and last basic requirement for membership is is that you pay membership dues of $15 per person per year. &nbsp;To pay your dues&nbsp;<strong>click the ""Pay Online"" button in the left hand column.</strong> A PAYPAL ACCOUNT IS NOT REQUIRED, YOU MAY PAY WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD.</p>
<p>We do not have a family rate, or provide refunds.</p>
<p><span><strong>Event Organizers /</strong></span> <strong><span><span>Trip Initiators Are Not Guides:</span> <br> </span></strong></p>
<p>Although Meetup uses the term ""Event Organizer"", Sacramento Sea Kayakers prefers the term ""Trip Initiator"".&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacramento Sea Kayakers does cooperative, non-guided, trips.&nbsp;Trip initiators are no more responsible for the safety of others than anyone else in the group.&nbsp; If you need or desire a guide, hire a professional through a commercial outfitter.</p>
<p>Each and every meetup participant is responsible for his/her own safety.&nbsp; Use your own judgement.&nbsp; Never blindly follow anyone into a situation you are unsure about.</p>
<p>On trips be prepared to take care of yourself.&nbsp; This does not mean that the other members of the group won't assist anyone who needs it, but such assistance should never be taken for granted, especially in difficult conditions. Be aware that, despite all good intentions, there is always a real possibility of being separated from the group.&nbsp; It is up to each and every participant to know the trip agenda.&nbsp; Approach each trip as if you were initiating and planning it yourself.&nbsp; Trip initiators are members of the club just like everyone else.&nbsp; Some may have more experience than you, while others may not.&nbsp; They are not professionals; don't be over-reliant on them.</p>
<p>Although trip initiators are not responsible for evaluating participants' kayaking abilities, they&nbsp; have the right to eliminate anyone who they feel is not prepared with the adequate skills or equipment for a particular trip.&nbsp; Trip initiators can organize (or not organize) the trip any way he or she wants.&nbsp;<strong>Get to know your trip initiator(s) and feel free to talk to him/her beforehand to find out how the trip is to be structured.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Becoming an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator</strong></span></p>

<p><span>We believe in fostering the independent, strong woman inside of every one of us.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in having a damn good time whether it's ""roughing it"" in a fabulous mountain house and hitting up the spa, or car camping and checking out the local hot springs, or 10-days in the backcountry without a shower.</span></p>

"I am happy project - Napa, CA","<p>Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances. According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego: &ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo; Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity. If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

Well-Seasoned Women,"<p>We are a group of dynamic retired or semi-retired&nbsp;<strong>women over 45.</strong> We live in the greater Sacramento area and are ready to star in the next stage of life. &nbsp;Our meetups take place from Lodi to Rocklin, from Davis to Placerville, and every place in between. We are looking for women with positive attitudes willing to contribute to their own growth and success as well as that of the community. &nbsp;We are interested in maintaining strong minds and bodies. <span>We believe in moving forward and giving back. &nbsp;Most of our activities take place weekdays, and some will include spouses and SO's. &nbsp;Please note that we strive to maintain a ""drama"" free environment. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are always looking for help, so email the leadership team if you are interested in hosting events. &nbsp;Due to size and liability issues we do not permit members to bring guests to events held in private homes or to events limited in number.</span></p>
<p><span>EXPECTATIONS:</span></p>
<p><span><span>*</span><span>Annual Membership Dues Required- $5. &nbsp;Dues payment required within 30 days of joining. &nbsp;Meetup charges for the right to post our events. &nbsp;We use these funds to pay fees, provide paper products at our potluck events, and host an annual anniversary party. No refunds are offered.</span></span></p>
<p><span>*</span>All members must post a profile picture of themselves and have a valid email within 30 days of joining. A picture of you <em>and</em> your pet, grandchild, children, etc is acceptable and must be posted in order to attend your first event with this group. &nbsp;We are often opening our homes to our members. &nbsp;This is a safety issue for those who do so and for those who attend. &nbsp;Please let us know if there is an issue of personal security that prevents you from doing this. &nbsp;We are happy to accommodate.</p>
<p><span>*</span>Members often would like to share rides to events. &nbsp;It is up to the person(s) looking for a ride to obtain one. We are unable to offer carpools to our members due to liability issues. &nbsp;When securing a ride with another member, it is the rider's responsibility to require adequate car insurance, safety of vehicle, and competence of driver. &nbsp; Any monetary contributions are to be arranged between the driver and the rider. WSW and its members assume no responsibility in the event of accident or injury.</p>
<p><span>*</span><span>Any individual with (3) ""no shows"" (includes canceling the morning of the event) or a history of ""late bail outs"" (canceling the day/night before the event) will have future RSVP's removed and be placed on waiting list to allow members in good standing to attend. Those who get moved to the waitlist the morning of an event and back out will also be charged a ""no show."" Those with 5 late bail outs will be removed from the group. &nbsp;</span>We have a firm 10 minute wait rule for events. Those who RSVP and are late may be left behind. It is your responsibility to take care and manage your own RSVPs - including your place on a wait list. &nbsp;This means changing your RSVP to ""no"" when you are unable to attend an event so that those on the wait list are able to move up.</p>
<p><span>*</span><span>The organizers reserve the right to remove anyone from the group who violates these rules, does not fit the parameters of our group, has not paid dues, has a negative impact on the group, or endangers the safety and security of our members. This is a group for retired women and not a dating site.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>*</span>This group does not support promotion of any kind, including: &nbsp;marketing, products, or people. Any postings or actions of this type will be removed along with the person who posted it.</span> <br> </span></p>
<p><span>*We love our pets - at home! &nbsp;Due to allergies and liability issues, please do not bring pets to events. &nbsp;Please know that many of our members who host events in their homes do have pets. It is your responsibility to inquire if you have issues with pets.</span></p>

Northern California Black Lesbians (NCBL),"<p><span>THERE HAS TO BE AN ACTUAL PICTURE OF YOURSELF for approval to join this group. This is a private group and only other members can see each other. This is a group for women of African Descent 35 years of age and older who love women. It's for anyone new to the Bay Area or not.&nbsp; If you're looking for a way to meet women close to your age group for friendship and socialization.</span></p>
<p><span>This group was started because many women over the age of 35 have shared their desire to meet other women 35 and over&nbsp;who share similar interest&nbsp;in dining out, dancing, game nights, potlucks, spa days,&nbsp;wine tasting, plays,&nbsp;musicals, concerts,&nbsp;retreats, traveling outside of California and the US, camping, &amp; hiking. This group is member driven and everyone's ideas are good ideas. &nbsp;We will meet up at various locations around the Bay Area.&nbsp; The group and events listed are member driven so member participation is important.</span></p>
<p><span><em>I and many of the women in this group believe that this group is much needed because there is a generations of women (35 years old and over) who are no longer interested in going to the bars, who are single or in a relationship, looking for a way to increase socializing with other black lesbians, women with maturity, with careers, women who want to be social and develop new friendships.</em></span></p>
<p><span>Let's make this a fun and social experience by attending as many events as possible and spreading the word.</span></p>

Gals Gone Fun,"<p>'Gals Gone Fun' welcomes women of all ages, whether single or married, regardless of age, ethnicity, or background. The Gals are buddies, pals, friends and chums. Our goal is to socialize, while doing activities we enjoy. 'Gals Gone Fun' will enrich your life with the fun activities we share. We love walking while chatting, then sipping coffee to sounds of laughter and conversation . We love getting out into the East Bay Hills, but we are not serious hikers. Together, we laugh and cry at the movies, and we all agree that the meal afterwards tastes yummier with the 'Gals'. We visit museums, Bay Area attractions, coffee houses, and meals out on the town. We attend concerts and plays, host parties, share cooking creations, knit, sew and bead together, volunteer and participate in fundraising events, plus we talk about books we read and TV series we are watching. Many 'Gals Gone Fun' are devoted to their dogs, so most 'Gal' walks welcome your buddy to our group, 'Dogs Gone Fun'. None of this would be fun without you and your event ideas! So please suggest activities or become a 'Gal' organizer so you can set up and lead some wonderful outings. And if you don't know what to do, just propose your idea and our skilled 'Gals' will gladly help you. We appreciate the friendship of a diversity of women. We know that together we are stronger and happier. Most activities are in central Contra Costa or Alameda County, but we love to explore and stretch our wings, so don't be surprised when we post fun opportunities in SF, Monterey, or anywhere in between.</p>","[{u'name': u'Kayaking', u'urlkey': u'kayaking', u'id': 590}, {u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Dining Out', u'urlkey': u'diningout', u'id': 713}, {u'name': u'Walking', u'urlkey': u'walkers', u'id': 933}, {u'name': u'Book Club', u'urlkey': u'bookclub', u'id': 2767}, {u'name': u'Live Music', u'urlkey': u'livemusic', u'id': 8652}, {u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Film', u'urlkey': u'film', u'id': 15029}, {u'name': u'Dog Walks', u'urlkey': u'dog-walks', u'id': 18874}, {u'name': u'Dinner and a Movie', u'urlkey': u'dinner-and-a-movie', u'id': 23778}]"

If you're interested in joining our group please send a request.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>We have a few important things for you to be aware of. &nbsp;Please read before joining:</b></p>
<p><b>Membership dues are a very low $6/year. &nbsp;This helps cover meetup costs and helps promote more invloved members.</b></p>
<p><b>We require that you have a current picture of yourself as well as your first name in your profile. &nbsp; This makes everyone more comfortable with meeting new people and makes it easier for us to find/recognize first timers.</b></p>
<p><b>This group can only be successful with active members. &nbsp;We want it to be a venue for making new and, hopefully, lasting friendships. &nbsp;That can only happen with members who participate in our events. &nbsp;Any member who has not been active with the group for 6 months may be removed, regardless of paid dues. You are always welcome to rejoin if you are able to participate and will only have to repay dues when they come due again.</b></p>
<p><b>Our organizers work hard to plan events, which often requires making reservations based on the number of people attending. &nbsp;Your RSVP is a firm commitment that you will be attending an event. &nbsp;We know life happens and plans change. &nbsp;If that happens, please be courteous and change your RSVP or communicate directly with the event host as soon as possible. &nbsp;If you are unsure whether or not you will be able to attend an event, please hold off on RSVP'ing until you are more certain. &nbsp;3 no shows and/or last minute cancellations, without communicating with the organizer, will result in removal from the group. &nbsp;Membership dues will not be refunded if this occurs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>We don't hold many events in personal residences, but it does happen on occasion. &nbsp;We require that you attend at least 2 public-place events before attending one that is being held at someone's home.</b> <br></p>
<p><b>There are lots of fun things planned and we all look forward to meeting you. &nbsp;Let's connect and have fun while creating memories and lasting friendships.</b></p>","[{u'name': u'Social Networking', u'urlkey': u'socialnetwork', u'id': 4422}, {u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Fun Times', u'urlkey': u'fun-times', u'id': 15117}, {u'name': u'Girlfriends', u'urlkey': u'girlfriends', u'id': 15144}, {u'name': u'Girls having fun', u'urlkey': u'girls-having-fun', u'id': 15413}, {u'name': u""Girls' Night Out"", u'urlkey': u'girls-night-out', u'id': 16550}]"

Our goal is to spark bonds between women who are unlikely to know each other and plant the seed of community.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Socialites, now: discoverHER.life , the resource hub for all women across Santa Cruz to discover, inspire &amp; celebrate together. From the Household Director, Stay-at-Home-Mom, the Solopreneur, to the Corporate Executive and the Retiree. With a Women in Business:&nbsp;<a href=""http://scs411.com/"">discoverHER directory</a>,&nbsp;events and resources. We are the community and platform to support you in business and in life.</p>

Women Partnering in Business East Bay,"<p>Please join us as we collaborate and create dynamic business partnerships between professional women in the San Francisco East Bay region. Our goal is to form business partnerships by sharing and supporting other women business owners and professionals in our community. Our group is not category specific, nor are there monthly attendance requirements. However, we do ask that you come to our events not only to expand your own business but also to help grow the businesses of the other attendees. We will alternate between lunch events and evening happy hours. &nbsp;At the lunches, there will be time for networking and everyone will have a short time to introduce yourself and your business. The evening events are an informal time to get to know each other and our businesses in a less structured format. Please bring business cards, flyers or any other promotional materials you wish to either event.</p>","[{u'name': u'Social Networking', u'urlkey': u'socialnetwork', u'id': 4422}, {u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u""Women's Business Networking"", u'urlkey': u'womens-business-networking', u'id': 21283}, {u'name': u'Women Small Business Owners', u'urlkey': u'women-small-business-owners', u'id': 23633}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'Female Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'female-entrepreneurs', u'id': 41905}, {u'name': u""Women's Networking"", u'urlkey': u'womens-networking', u'id': 43484}, {u'name': u""Women's Support"", u'urlkey': u'womens-support', u'id': 144477}]"
Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>

Awaken The Goddess Within And Transform Your Health,"<p>The purpose of this group is to have a circle of women who are passionate about getting stronger, healthier, and awakening the inner Goddess that is inside each and every one of us. </p> 
<p>The organizer of this Meetup is Jen Seregos. She has been in the health industry for over 10 years in the fitness and nutrition space. In 2011, she found out she had a genetic mutation that made her susceptible to cancer and had to have her breasts surgically removed to prevent cancer. Shortly after that, her husband left her and a within 2 years of that, her mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and lost her battle in 2014. </p> 
<p>Jen had hit rock bottom and through this process of loss, grief, and failure, she realized that there was more to being ""healthy"" than just exercise and eating right. She began to incorporate what she needed in order to have a healthy mental, emotional, and spiritual state as well. &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>When she discovered the formula to have a complete, holistic, and integrated approach to health, she regained her confidence and her inner Goddess.</p> 
<p>Now, her passion is sharing this process with her fellow women!</p> 
<p>Join us as we reclaim our power together, get healthy, strong, and ready to take on the world. </p>

<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

"Women Who Dine, Drink, and Curse","<p>If you're a woman who is interested in making new friends and you have a relaxed attitude, join us! The plan is to have frequent and varied events so there is always something on the agenda. Dinners, brunch, scenic walks, festivals, happy hour--we'll try to find interesting and fun things to do.</p>
<p>I hate to start out with a rules list but in attending other meet-ups, I think it's important to set expectations. The best Meet Up group I was involved in only allowed 100 members and kept a waitlist of prospects. The administrator set up basic rules at the very beginning. Long lasting friendships resulted from that group and I'd love to see the same thing here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So, these are the ""rules""</b></p>
<p>1. If you sign up and are inactive for 2 months, you're automatically removed. If you're going out of town or will be inactive but want to remain involved, just shoot us an email and we'll keep you active.</p>
<p>2. If you RSVP and then are a no show twice, you're removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We'll cap the group at 100. Please, if you join, look around and decide this isn't for you, leave the group so there's room for someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The yearly fee for membership is $5.00. It costs $15 per month to keep the group active. Once that is paid for, the remaining fees will be used however the group sees fit--a party or perhaps a holiday donation to a charity. Meet Up no longer allows us to accept fees through the group so we request that you either pay $5 at your first meet up or use PayPal.</p>
<p>5. You are welcome to attend the first event on us, if you want to continue, please pay the fee. If you attend an event and then we don't hear from you, we'll remove you so someone else can join.</p>
<p>6. We won't accept members who don't have a photo of themselves in their bio. We want to be able to recognize you at meet ups. It also cuts down on people who spam huge numbers of groups.</p>
<p>7. We won't accept members who do not live in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. We won't accept members who don't have a personal profile picture. We want to be able to recognize you at events and to know you are a real person.</p>
<p><b>Finally, if you are interested in organizing events and setting up meet-ups, please let us know. It is really helpful to have several active organizers putting in events. It's also a great opportunity to find people who like to do the things you like to do!&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Input is appreciated. If you have suggestions for the group, we want to hear them so don't be shy.</b></p>
<p><b>Thank you.</b></p>","[{u'name': u'Dining Out', u'urlkey': u'diningout', u'id': 713}, {u'name': u'New In Town', u'urlkey': u'newintown', u'id': 1273}, {u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u""Women's Networking"", u'urlkey': u'womens-networking', u'id': 43484}, {u'name': u'Making New Friends Over 40', u'urlkey': u'making-new-friends-over-40', u'id': 71412}, {u'name': u'Meeting New People/Making Friends', u'urlkey': u'meeting-new-people-making-friends', u'id': 916542}, {u'name': u'Meeting old friends and making new friends', u'urlkey': u'meeting-old-friends-and-making-new-friends', u'id': 1187892}]"

Polka Dot Powerhouse Palo Alto Chapter,"<p>First, it's important to note that we are not a networking group with attendance and referral requirements! We are a connections organization! I truly believe that when women connect and genuinely get to know each other that then they want to help each other whether it is personal development or their business. This group has improved not only my life but so many of us because we surround ourselves with positivity! We officially launched the Palo Alto/Los Altos chapter back in March and after just a few short months we are now over 60 members strong in this chapter and meeting twice a month! Currently we meet at Breathe Holistic Health center (a members space) from 11:30am-1:30pm 2x a month. Registration is required and last minute cancellations heavily frowned upon.

Northern California Black Lesbians (NCBL),"<p><span>THERE HAS TO BE AN ACTUAL PICTURE OF YOURSELF for approval to join this group. This is a private group and only other members can see each other. This is a group for women of African Descent 35 years of age and older who love women. It's for anyone new to the Bay Area or not.&nbsp; If you're looking for a way to meet women close to your age group for friendship and socialization.</span></p>
<p><span>This group was started because many women over the age of 35 have shared their desire to meet other women 35 and over&nbsp;who share similar interest&nbsp;in dining out, dancing, game nights, potlucks, spa days,&nbsp;wine tasting, plays,&nbsp;musicals, concerts,&nbsp;retreats, traveling outside of California and the US, camping, &amp; hiking. This group is member driven and everyone's ideas are good ideas. &nbsp;We will meet up at various locations around the Bay Area.&nbsp; The group and events listed are member driven so member participation is important.</span></p>
<p><span><em>I and many of the women in this group believe that this group is much needed because there is a generations of women (35 years old and over) who are no longer interested in going to the bars, who are single or in a relationship, looking for a way to increase socializing with other black lesbians, women with maturity, with careers, women who want to be social and develop new friendships.</em></span></p>
<p><span>Let's make this a fun and social experience by attending as many events as possible and spreading the word.</span></p>
<p><span>You can contact me directly if you have any questions or comments.&nbsp; I look forward to meeting you soon. For admission into this group you must post a picture of yourself.

Mistaken Identity - You are Black Enough!  (West Coast),"<p>The original meet up began in Atlanta, GA. I haven't found anything similar in California, so I thought I would start a West Coast chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many times have you been told you're not Black enough? Mistaken Identity is an organization created for the sole purpose of extending to its Members an opportunity to find their own Comfort Zone. It was established as a network tool to introduce positive, independent, self-loving African American women to others who have been subjected to the ""theory"" of not being Black enough.</p>
<p>Mistaken Identity serves as a safe haven for African American women to come together to better themselves and the lives of others through a variety of social activities and volunteer projects. If you are interested in becoming an active member in the development of this Organization, please do not hesitate to join us. We look forward to meeting!</p>
<p>Some areas of interest include: Art, Literature, Community Service, Concerts, Dance, Dining Out, Golf, Health and Fitness, Meditation, Spa, Theater, Travel, and Yoga.</p>","[{u'name': u'Wine', u'urlkey': u'wine', u'id': 611}, {u'name': u'Dining Out', u'urlkey': u'diningout', u'id': 713}, {u'name': u'Social Networking', u'urlkey': u'socialnetwork', u'id': 4422}, {u'name': u'Live Music', u'urlkey': u'livemusic', u'id': 8652}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Music', u'urlkey': u'music', u'id': 15018}, {u'name': u'Girlfriends', u'urlkey': u'girlfriends', u'id': 15144}, {u'name': u'Girls having fun', u'urlkey': u'girls-having-fun', u'id': 15413}, {u'name': u'Adventure', u'urlkey': u'adventure', u'id': 15892}, {u'name': u'Movie Nights', u'urlkey': u'movie-nights', u'id': 15940}, {u'name': u""Girls' Night Out"", u'urlkey': u'girls-night-out', u'id': 16550}, {u'name': u'Black Women', u'urlkey': u'black-women', u'id': 18634}, {u'name': u'Dinner and a Movie', u'urlkey': u'dinner-and-a-movie', u'id': 23778}, {u'name': u'African American Women', u'urlkey': u'african-american-women', u'id': 27978}, {u'name': u'Weekend Getaways', u'urlkey': u'weekend-getaways', u'id': 28784}]"

Conscious Uncoupling Group Support for Divorce and Breakups,"<p><span>Are you feeling hurt, sad and alone - perhaps even emotionally distraught - over a divorce or breakup? Dealing with an ex who refuses to acknowledge their actions, or to step up and handle your separation with kindness and consciousness? Are you doing your best to surf waves of grief and sadness? Or perhaps even like you were hit by a truck and confused about what happened?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you feeling a lack of resolution or clarity? Wondering how you can avoid going through something like this again? Or perhaps even hopeless about having another relationship?</span> <br></p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, there is hope. It doesn't matter if your divorce or breakup was a few weeks ago or a few years ago; getting the right kind of support and doing some self-reflection is not just critical to your own healing, but also the doorway to even better relationships with a future partner, your friends and family and - perhaps most of all - yourself.</p>
<p>I became a Conscious Uncoupling coach after I went through my own devastating break up. I felt all of these things.... hit by a truck!&nbsp; Devastated!! Confused!&nbsp; And my ex refused to even explain to me what was happening or why. It has taken time and work - showing up - but I know I am a better person / friend / family member for it, and I will make a much better partner in the future. I feel empowered and hopeful, and you will, too.</p>
<p>This group will offer:</p>
<p>1. informational sessions about Conscious Uncoupling: what it is, how to do it, and how to decide whether to do it on your own or with a coach.</p>
<p>2. Group coaching in a confidential and deeply loving and supportive group.</p>
<p>3. One-day workshops that will be nurturing, informative, eye-opening and healing.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you at an event. Events will be held in both Folsom and Placerville.</p>

Bay Area Indian Divorce Support & Recovery Group (IDSRG),"<p>Few years ago, I had started Bay Area Indian Single Parents &amp; Divorcees group, the group was community partners with India Community Center (ICC). The goal was to help support, educate, survive, recover from the life changing events and help people find a life partner in the process. I found my love, or at least thought so, got remarried, reasons which I got out of the group and let friends manage it. The old group is still alive under a different name, but lost it's mission, it's original charter and become a party place. Plus unfortunate it is, that I find myself in family court, seeking Nullity and looking for support again. Not finding any, starting this new group for divorce support and recovery.</p>
<p>You can join this group if you are of Indian origin, living in bay area and going through divorce or divorced looking for support. I'll allow middle-aged never married singles in the group, it there intent is to find life partner and settle down. If you are trying to save your marriage, please try hard, especially if you have kids. The grass always looks green on other side, but it never is!</p>
<p>Note, this group is not a party group or a pickup joint. Dating is not the goal, but if long term relationships and remarriages happen between group members, we all will be happy and wish them well.</p>
<p>This a community effort and I would like all members to participate. We can be friends, provide support 1-1 or have discussions in group setting. We could have attorneys, educators, mediators, counselors, therapists and parenting experts come give talks to group members. Is there is enough interest, I will look to partner with ICC again. I'm a First Year Law School student myself and would be willing to help (pro-bono) anyone who reaches out to me, limited by my knowledge and experience. Please do note that I am not an attorney as yet, so anything I say or do is friendly help and any action you take based on discussions in this group is at your own risk. You should always get your legal advice from your attorney.</p>
<p>All members are recommended to maintain clear photo on their profile, use complete/real name and answer all profile question honestly. I understand its not always feasible to have profile photo and real name while going through divorce, in that case, please you must send me a private message with real identity.</p>
<p>Everything discussed in the group will be confidential and all members will treat fellow members with respect, be sensitive to their issues.</p>
<p>This is a group for good people who find themselves in an unfortunate situation, need support and want to live though difficult times.</p>","[{u'name': u'Singles', u'urlkey': u'singles', u'id': 498}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Desis', u'urlkey': u'desis', u'id': 15261}, {u'name': u'Indian Singles', u'urlkey': u'indian-singles', u'id': 16475}, {u'name': u'Newly Divorced', u'urlkey': u'newly-divorced', u'id': 16687}, {u'name': u'Divorce/Separation', u'urlkey': u'divorce-separation', u'id': 17265}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Divorce/Grief Support', u'urlkey': u'divorce-grief-support', u'id': 19311}, {u'name': u'Dating and Relationships', u'urlkey': u'dating-and-relationships', u'id': 20246}, {u'name': u'Divorced Parents', u'urlkey': u'divorced-parents', u'id': 24314}, {u'name': u'indian families', u'urlkey': u'indian-families', u'id': 29989}, {u'name': u'Rebuilding Your Life After Divorce', u'urlkey': u'rebuilding-your-life-after-divorce', u'id': 36423}, {u'name': u'Divorced Women', u'urlkey': u'divorced-women', u'id': 49572}, {u'name': u'Single Parents', u'urlkey': u'single-parties', u'id': 59433}, {u'name': u'Divorced', u'urlkey': u'divorced', u'id': 125105}]"

Well-Seasoned Women,"<p>We are a group of dynamic retired or semi-retired&nbsp;<strong>women over 45.</strong> We live in the greater Sacramento area and are ready to star in the next stage of life. &nbsp;Our meetups take place from Lodi to Rocklin, from Davis to Placerville, and every place in between. We are looking for women with positive attitudes willing to contribute to their own growth and success as well as that of the community. &nbsp;We are interested in maintaining strong minds and bodies. <span>We believe in moving forward and giving back. &nbsp;Most of our activities take place weekdays, and some will include spouses and SO's. &nbsp;Please note that we strive to maintain a ""drama"" free environment. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are always looking for help, so email the leadership team if you are interested in hosting events. &nbsp;Due to size and liability issues we do not permit members to bring guests to events held in private homes or to events limited in number.</span></p>
<p><span>EXPECTATIONS:</span></p>
<p><span><span>*</span><span>Annual Membership Dues Required- $5. &nbsp;Dues payment required within 30 days of joining. &nbsp;Meetup charges for the right to post our events. &nbsp;We use these funds to pay fees, provide paper products at our potluck events, and host an annual anniversary party. No refunds are offered.</span></span></p>
<p><span>*</span>All members must post a profile picture of themselves and have a valid email within 30 days of joining. A picture of you <em>and</em> your pet, grandchild, children, etc is acceptable and must be posted in order to attend your first event with this group. &nbsp;We are often opening our homes to our members. &nbsp;This is a safety issue for those who do so and for those who attend. &nbsp;Please let us know if there is an issue of personal security that prevents you from doing this. &nbsp;We are happy to accommodate.</p>
<p><span>*</span>Members often would like to share rides to events. &nbsp;It is up to the person(s) looking for a ride to obtain one. We are unable to offer carpools to our members due to liability issues. &nbsp;When securing a ride with another member, it is the rider's responsibility to require adequate car insurance, safety of vehicle, and competence of driver. &nbsp; Any monetary contributions are to be arranged between the driver and the rider. WSW and its members assume no responsibility in the event of accident or injury.</p>
<p><span>*</span><span>Any individual with (3) ""no shows"" (includes canceling the morning of the event) or a history of ""late bail outs"" (canceling the day/night before the event) will have future RSVP's removed and be placed on waiting list to allow members in good standing to attend. Those who get moved to the waitlist the morning of an event and back out will also be charged a ""no show."" Those with 5 late bail outs will be removed from the group. &nbsp;</span>We have a firm 10 minute wait rule for events. Those who RSVP and are late may be left behind. It is your responsibility to take care and manage your own RSVPs - including your place on a wait list. &nbsp;This means changing your RSVP to ""no"" when you are unable to attend an event so that those on the wait list are able to move up.</p>
<p><span>*</span><span>The organizers reserve the right to remove anyone from the group who violates these rules, does not fit the parameters of our group, has not paid dues, has a negative impact on the group, or endangers the safety and security of our members. This is a group for retired women and not a dating site.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>*</span>This group does not support promotion of any kind, including: &nbsp;marketing, products, or people. Any postings or actions of this type will be removed along with the person who posted it.</span> <br> </span></p>
<p><span>*We love our pets - at home! &nbsp;Due to allergies and liability issues, please do not bring pets to events. &nbsp;Please know that many of our members who host events in their homes do have pets. It is your responsibility to inquire if you have issues with pets.</span></p>
<p><span>*Don't forget to check out our Facebook Group page!</span></p>

Walnut Creek Girlfriends (40s+),"<p>Our Girlfriend Meetup community is all about building friendships with awesome women in the Walnut Creek and surrounding areas. Who couldn't use another friend right?&nbsp;Developing new friendships, and<strong>&nbsp;supporting one another while having fun</strong> is what we are about.&nbsp;In our 40's-50's many of us have been through many life transitions. We are&nbsp;single, married, with significant others, divorced (or going through one), or widowers. Some of us are new to the area, while others have lived here for a while. </p>
<p>We strive to&nbsp;have&nbsp;a <em>""<strong>drama-free</strong>"",</em> fun and informal&nbsp;environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is for you to reach out and get to know one another to find common interests with other amazing gals so&nbsp;you can also get together outside of the meet up and develop long term friendships. We ask that you introduce yourself to one another and also help welcome newcomers by introducing them. <strong>If you are a little on the shy side, please privately message JoAnn Horner&nbsp;for a one-on-one or a smaller intro to a few of the ""regular"" attendees.</strong> </p>
<p>We are working towards providing a&nbsp;variety for everyone&nbsp;that range from low&nbsp;or no cost to a day excursion.&nbsp;We welcome your ideas as well.</p>
<p>Many events will be in the surrounding Walnut Creek and Tri-Valley areas as well as Benicia. Some examples are Coffee/Tea, Happy Hours, dancing, Dinner, Brunch, Mid-week lunches, book club, wine-tasting, networking happy hour or lunch, spa day, beer tasting, day trips to the ocean, movies, bowling, game night,&nbsp;paint nights, hiking,&nbsp;festivals, concerts, bands, art/craft events,&nbsp;and maybe the occasional spiritual or personal growth meet up. </p>
<p>Join our Facebook Group: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/WalnutCreekGirlfriends/"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/WalnutCreekGirlfriends/</a>&nbsp;where you can post suggestions or get a last minute group together for something fun.</p>
<p>Please also periodically visit our ""Polls""</p>

Whether you are an experienced speaker or you're just getting started, we invite you to join us for a meeting unlike any other you have attended before.</p>
<p><b>The Sacramento Speakers Network is focused on the business of speaking and how to monetize more of what you're doing in your business or your speaking. </b>The majority of our members are business professionals or owners plus speakers or budding speakers and therefore we all benefit by sharing resources, discussing strategies for generating more business and speaking engagements, networking and building relationships within the group--all while learning advanced business skills.</p>
<p>If you represent an organization or group that is in need of a speaker, please browse our member list. You can also contact Katrina Sawa for assistance, the Organizer of this group or on her website at <a href=""http://www.JumpstartYourMarketing.com"">http://www.JumpstartYourMarketing.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no cost to join us online, we have complimentary webinars monthly as of 2018 as well as in person lunch time meetings that do have a fee and include your lunch. We hope you will join us for one of our lively and informative meetings online or in person!</p>

<p><b>Are you ready to become a public speaker?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Do you know that speaking is the #1 way you can get clients when you have your own business?</b></p>
<p><b>Speaking is something that every entrepreneur should be focusing more on:&nbsp;</b><br></p>
<p>- how to do it</p>
<p>- what to speak about</p>
<p>- how to incorporate it into your business</p>
<p>- how to get leads from speaking</p>
<p>- how to sell from stage or how to sell from a webinar</p>
<p>But the problem is that very few entrepreneurs actually do this. OR they do it but don't really understand how it can correlate to sales in their business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Speaking is something that you want to get some training with on:</b><br></p>
<p>- how to create your talks and presentations</p>
<p>- how to own the stage</p>
<p>- how to create a speaker sheet</p>
<p>- how to get speaking gigs and opportunities</p>
<p>- how to present yourself during the speaking gig</p>
<p>- how to gather leads during speaking gigs&nbsp;</p>
<p>- in person or virtually</p>
<p>- how to sell from stage&nbsp;</p>
<p>- how to follow up effectively (most of your sales will come in the follow up!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>- how to present yourself as a speaker on your website and online social profiles</p>
<p>- and soooo much more!</p>
<p>The webinar here is a snippet of what we do at the Sacramento Speaker &amp; Entrepreneur Network meetings and online webinars. We have a community on Meetup and Facebook that anyone can join to learn more about speaking to grow your business, entrepreneurship, business and marketing.&nbsp;</p>

Writers Who Mean Business (TM),"<p>In an effort to form a community of expertise and help authors learn not  just tips to improve their writing but build a successful writing  career, 3L Publishing hosts this free group Writers Who Mean Business.

Bay Area Aspiring & New Entrepreneurs Group,"<p>Description of Community Group:</p>
<p>It takes skill, resources and a community to create a successful business, be it a high-tech start-up or a small business. At Golden Gate University, many of our students choose to start their own ventures upon graduation, building on the knowledge they've gained with us. Business owners also come to GGU looking to fill gaps in their training and gain the confidence it takes to compete in the climate today. Many of our faculty are themselves investors and entrepreneurs, and bring a wealth of experience to the mix.</p>
<p>This group is yet another step in our commitment to providing resources to the broader Bay Area business world. We hope to provide a platform for dialog between entrepreneurs, investors, students, Civic leaders and educators through hosting networking events and helping others do the same.</p>

Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Creative Circle', u'urlkey': u'creativecircle', u'id': 10447}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Family Constellations', u'urlkey': u'family-constellations', u'id': 15521}, {u'name': u""Women's Circle"", u'urlkey': u'womens-circle', u'id': 17276}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Growth', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-growth', u'id': 17658}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Transformation', u'urlkey': u'transformation', u'id': 21591}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Expressive Arts', u'urlkey': u'expressive-arts', u'id': 53903}, {u'name': u'Sacred Ceremony and Ritual', u'urlkey': u'sacred-ceremony-and-ritual', u'id': 59894}, {u'name': u""Women's Support"", u'urlkey': u'womens-support', u'id': 144477}]"

San Mateo Business Masters,"<p>The San Mateo Business Masters group is first and foremost a free entrepreneur networking group for solo-preneurs and owner-operated businesses of all sizes. Whether you are a business veteran or a new entrepreneur, our networking events provide for a safe and secure environment to all. In fact, the diversity in members brings added benefits to us all.</p>
<p>We meet once a week for a breakfast mixer and to discuss and learn about local business and entrepreneurship issues. The meetings start promptly with the mixer portion (networking) of the event. Then, while we eat breakfast we invite the speaker of the week to enlighten us about different aspect of business management. Each week the topics and the speakers are different. Then after the meeting, members who desire can stick around or set appointments to get to know each other better.Members of the group with relevant topics will be invited to speak in front of the group and share their expertise if they desire to.</p>
<p>In this challenging economy it is important to have a group of peers and business associates to count on. Yet, most networking groups, like BNI's and BRN's are nothing more than a place to pass business cards around.</p>
<p>Business Masters is different. We understand that solid and long term business relationships are not forged by handing business cards to strangers, but rather by connecting with people and making friends. Like a member previously stated: ""Nobody cares to do business with business cards, but we all care about people!""</p>
<p>Unlike many other networking groups that charge you hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year, Business Masters is 100% no charge. Obviously you have to buy your own food, but that's it. We know that by not charging a membership fee more people are inclined to attend. The more people who attend the more relationship bonds are created. That's how economies are created!</p>
<p>We are all looking forward to meeting you at next week's event.</p>","[{u'name': u'Small Business', u'urlkey': u'smallbiz', u'id': 389}, {u'name': u'Marketing', u'urlkey': u'marketing', u'id': 1238}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Social', u'urlkey': u'social', u'id': 10581}, {u'name': u'Business Referral Networking', u'urlkey': u'business-referral-networking', u'id': 15405}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Professional Networking', u'urlkey': u'professional-networking', u'id': 15720}, {u'name': u'Business Strategy', u'urlkey': u'business-strategy', u'id': 17635}]"

Spontaneous Fun People in San Francisco,"<p>Hey Everyone!

<p>I love doing random fun stuff throughout the week, hiking, exploring anything anywhere, trying new things (because that new thing could turn into something awesome or a new hobby), sports (going to a game, watching sports on TV, and playing sports!), doing random weekend trips, and going to awesome events! I'm always down to do anything!</p>
<p>So I want to meet people that are compassionate, fun, caring, honest, and all other types of awesomeness that also like to do random fun stuff with other fun people. And it would also be really great for all of us to expand our networks. I would love to meet people that are involved in local non-profit organization and in international non-profit organizations, but of course EVERYONE (no matter what you do) is welcomed!</p>

We believe in embracing & putting ACTION into our businesses, personal lives & our communities instead of just talking about it.

It is our goal that each month you will have the opportunity to learn business tips & ideas from people who are leaders in their company and/or community - people who walk their talk and understand & experience the same hiccups & joys in their business everyday that we all do!

We also will learn about a non-profit or community service group that we can support - both by the money from the raffle but also each month we will share an opportunity for us to get involved in serving personally at a scheduled Day of Service. . Each month we will have light refreshments served by a local caterer/food supplier. And what fun to celebrate and learn more about 5 Spotlighted businesses each month!

Each person who attends has the opportunity to display their products/services information in a 2' area.

Girl Develop It San Jose,"<p>Women Developers and Programmers!<br>

 Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.</p>
<p><br>

 It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask ""stupid questions.""</p>
<p><br>

 We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>

<p>Mindfulness teaches us about ourselves, our thoughts, our emotions and how and why we experience our lives the way we do. Through this awareness, we can experience our lives more fully and live our lives on our terms instead of habitually reacting to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technique also has wonderful physical benefits in addition to leading to inner peace and happiness. <br> <br> We offer drop in group meditation (Shoshin or Beginners Mind) each Wednesday morning. The group organizer, Karen Miller, is available by appointment for individual or group instruction. <br></p>
<p>The 'Shoshin""meditations are designed for beginners in mind but are equally beneficial for experienced practitioners. <span>Shoshin (Beginners Mind) Group Meditation: Wednesday mornings @ 9:45-11:00</span></p>

Living & Trusting The Law of Attraction,"In this inspirational uplifting group, we will include the power of intention along with the law of attraction and the power of partnership to create miraculous results in our lives. We will play with actively moving from fear to love and trust, and explore how to improve our lives and the lives of others through positive thinking, good feeling, intentionality and aligned action. Our meetings will include motivational movies or CD excerpts from various progressive thinkers and teachers, insightful experiential exercises, enlightening group processes and opportunities to share, connect with and support each other.

Challenging times call us to sharpen our focus, clarify our intention, take action consistent with our deepest desires and to surrender to trusting Spirit and Law of attraction like never before.

Mystic Shaman,"<p>The Hopi Elders Speak, ""We Are the Ones We've Been Waiting for..."" ... become a co-creator&nbsp;in your&nbsp;life.... Visualizing and preparing&nbsp;to achieve&nbsp;certain goals puts you in the driver's seat of your life vehicle.</p>
<p>The techniques used for creative visualization open one's imagination&nbsp;to limitless possibilities. Meditation journeys take many forms, and each class is truly a unique and wonderful experience. Learn techniques for adjusting your perspective of your life path. When you change your view, you are empowered to change your destination. Whatever you focus upon, that is where you will land - ask any hang-glider what method they use to assure a smooth landing - don't look at the obstacles, but the possibilities.</p>

Oakland LifeFire Laughter Yoga,"<p>Want to jumpstart your joy? Join us and get happified!</p>
<p>The global Laughter Yoga movement was started by Dr. Madan Kataria, an MD from India, in 1995. There are now over 6000 ""Laughter Clubs"" in over 70 countries around the world spreading peace and joy through laughter! <br> <br>Laughter Yoga does not use the familiar ""Hatha Yoga"" poses or asanas. It is not based on humor or jokes, which are very subjective. Rather it combines playful, easy laughter exercises with yogic breathing and a final relaxation. And like yoga it IS a ""practice"", also called ""intentional laughter"", that taps into the mind-body connection to lift your mood, reduce stress, lower blood pressure and boost your immune system while you have fun. After laughing and playing with this fabulous group, you will leave energized and relaxed. How cool is that!</p>
<p>Oakland LIfefire Laughter Yoga was started in 2007&nbsp;by Annie Goglia, a certified Laughter Yoga Teacher and Life Coach.&nbsp;Annie loves&nbsp;to share&nbsp;her laughter with others with an open heart. She&nbsp;was trained by the founder of Laughter Yoga, Dr. Kataria. In 2013, Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Liz Nichols joined her as co-leader. <br></p>
<p>We are usually a mix of ""regulars"" and newcomers. Drop-ins are super-welcome. No mats needed. Adults and older teens of all levels of physically fitness are welcome. Wear comfortable clothing for easier laughing.</p>
<p><strong>Laughing with others is priceless. Oakland LifeFire Laughter Meetups are free! We welcome donations to help with our costs. You can click on the ""chip in"" button on the left, or bring your donation when you come to a Meetup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This ""laughter club"" meets two or more Mondays per month, except major holidays. See the list of upcoming Meetups for the current schedule.</strong></p>

<p>The first act we do in our life is to breathe in. And the last act of our life is to breathe out. Between this first breath in and the last breath out are all the breaths that we call life. The breath is our best friend -- it's always with us. And yet, we hardly know much about it. What's more ... it holds some timeless secrets to our health, peace of mind, and well-being.</p>
<p>""There is a great secret in the breath. You have an in-built ability to calm the mind, heal the body, and energize the whole system in minutes. The secret is in the breath.""</p>
<p>With just a little practice it's easy to use your breath to instantly</p>

<li>infuse your body with energy</li>
<li>detoxify through the breath</li>
<li>make your mind calm</li>
<li>control negative emotions</li>
<li>increase focus and concentration</li>
<li>create a sense of well-being</li>

Skills like setting and enforcing boundaries, actively respecting yourself and others, knowing when and how to take care of yourself, being assertive--all play a part.

San Jose - Manjushri Lineage Buddhist Group,"<p>Hello<br> <br> LEARN, CONTEMPLATE, CULTIVATE and TRANSFORM.<br> <br> Welcome to the <span>meetup group</span> ""Inner Peace &amp; Happiness Buddhist Study and Meditation&nbsp;Group"". This is a wonderful opportunity, whether you are just beginning or have been studying for awhile, to join other warm-heart, sincere Buddhist Practitioners as we explore Mahayana &amp; Vajrayana Buddhism.<br> <br> Buddhism is about transforming the mind and discovering the path to true happiness. To achieve this, first we need to take focused action to uproot the negative emotions, destructive mental constructs, and negative habits that continually cause suffering for ourselves. We also need to cultivate virtues in our mind such as compassion, loving-kindness, and wisdom. This way we can transform ourselves to a point where we experience stability, peace of mind, and lightness within our own mind. This results in happiness for ourselves and others.<br> <br> Our group is under the guidance of our precious Lama Namnang Mingjo Dorje Rinpoche, a very humble yet immensely accomplished yogi, whose sincerity, dedication &amp; guidance is very inspiring &amp; brings the <span>Buddhist teachings</span> alive in our daily lives.<br> <br> The aim of our group is to provide our members with both an in-person as well as online learning environment to explore the incredible wisdom and application of Buddhism. We have on-going weekly teachings &amp; study groups that provide practitioners with an opportunity to not only learn <span>Buddhist philosophy</span>, helping us to better understand the interplay of cause and effect (the law of karma) and help us to contemplate and look at ways to change ourselves. As well as learn <span>Buddhist meditation practices</span> that help us to increase &amp; stabilize key virtues (charity, ethical discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom) within us, and give us a first-hand personal experience of what it is like to experience a mind that is stable, quiet, calm, peaceful, joyful and light.<br> <br> This is a very rare opportunity to study Buddhism in a beautiful blessed environment together with a group of sincere seekers. All of us are also searching and wishing to discover and nurture the essence of our Buddha potential. Come and join us. Absorb yourself in this incredible wisdom and create more inner-peace, stability, &amp; happiness in your mind, your life, &amp; your world! Seize the moment!</p>

"Reiki Tummo Healing, Heart Meditation & Natural Walking","<p>""All truth is in your heart, not in the physical heart, but in the core within yourself where your true self resides.

<p>&ldquo;No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves. &rdquo;</p>

The East Bay NLP Meetup Group,"<p>This is a Meet Up for people interested in Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).</p>
<p>NLP is called ""The Study of the Structure of Human Experience."" It is also a self development practice: Once we know something about how we structure our experience, we can find ways to re-structure it in ways that provide us with the experience of life we would prefer.</p>
<p>NLP is a remarkably elegant and deeply respectful set of tools to uncover unconscious beliefs and structures that determine our experience, and--again, at the unconcious level--introduce new beliefs and structures to our hidden selves.</p>
<p>At these meetups, we learn and practice NLP techniques, and learn about and discuss NLP principles and frameworks. We have had a number of meetups so far and they have let people practice NLP skills in a relaxed, fun environment. We've had everyone from experienced practitioners to those just starting out.</p>
<p>For those of you who know something about NLP, we've worked on anchoring, rapport, language patterns, parts work, and much more. So come and explore!</p>","[{u'name': u'Hypnosis', u'urlkey': u'hypnosis', u'id': 2521}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'NLP Practice Group', u'urlkey': u'nlp-practice-group', u'id': 32273}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)', u'urlkey': u'nlp-neurolinguistic-programming', u'id': 43763}]"

The Shadow Effect Meet Up,"<p>
  <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
  <strong>What is the Shadow?</strong>
</p>
<p>The shadow contains all the parts of ourselves that we try to hide, deny or suppress. It is the keeper of all the aspects of ourselves that we dislike and the qualities that we judge as unacceptable. The shadow wears many faces: angry, critical, fearful, lazy, controlling, selfish, weak, pathetic&hellip; These are the faces we don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t want to show the world and the faces we don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t want to show ourselves. Most of us expend huge amounts of energy trying to get rid of or control these unwanted aspects of ourselves. We hope that by hiding or fixing our 
<span>""</span>bad qualities
<span>""</span> we will have the peace, success and happiness we desire. Most of us are convinced that we are flawed and inadequate so we become masters of disguise, and go to great lengths to hide our bad qualities from those around us &ndash; even from ourselves.</p>
<p>The result of turning our backs on our dark side? A life that slips by only half lived. Dreams that are never realized, or worse, that lay buried under years of resignation and shame. Until we make peace with our shadow we will continue to be at war with ourselves. And our outer world will mirror our inner struggle. What we resist persists &ndash; and we will create and attract from others that which we most dislike in ourselves. Until we feel authentic compassion for each and every aspect of ourselves, we will continue to draw forth people and events that will mirror the negative feelings we have about ourselves. Until we take back our power and forgive ourselves for being human we will attract people who push our buttons and reactivate our emotional wounds. And until we find the courage to love ourselves completely, we will never truly be able to experience the love from those around us. We don
<span>&rsquo;</span>t need to guess how we really feel about ourselves at the deepest level. All we have to do is look at how the outer world treats us. If we
<span>&rsquo;</span>re not getting the respect, love and appreciation we desire from the outer world, it
<span>&rsquo;</span>s more than likely we aren
<span>&rsquo;</span>t giving these things to ourselves. This is the benevolence of the Universe in action. The whole world is a mirror of our own consciousness, and when we make peace with the disowned aspects of ourselves, we make peace with the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <strong>The Shadow Effect Movie</strong>
</p>
<p>The Shadow Effect, a visually stunning and cutting-edge documentary, will inspire you to step out of the self that you&rsquo;ve known and break free from the bonds of the past. Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Dr. David Simon, and other world-renowned thinkers join Debbie Ford to reveal the transformative power of your shadow&mdash;the parts of yourself that you dislike and disown, the past that you regret and repress, and the future that is waiting to be birthed. The Shadow Effect will leave you breathing deeper as you take back your power and step into the possibility of the next greatest evolution of yourself.

"Love, Intuition and Spirituality","<p>The purpose of this group is to learn how to live from love, and connect to your intuition and spirituality. There are only 2 basic emotions, fear and love. If you choose to live from love and inner wisdom, this meetup is for you.</p>
<p>Your intuition is how your higher self, your spirit, communicates with you. It is all wise, all knowing and all loving. It knows the past, present and future and is not programmed like the mind is. Everyone is intuitive. It comes with the human package. Only fears block it. Remove your fears and you can live as the master of your life!</p>
<p>Spirituality is living from love rather than fear. It is choosing to be the loving person you really are. Awaken to your true essence of love and your life can be amazing! It has helped me be healthier, happier, more successful, and fulfilled in every area of my life! And you can, too! Go for it!<br></p>
<p>The fun and profound events are healing and transformational, because the goal is to to help you to enjoy a peaceful, loving and joyful life. <br></p>
<p>As a licensed&nbsp; Marriage and Family Therapist, intuitive counselor, spiritual teacher/healer and author,&nbsp; I will be honored to support your connection to your wisdom, love and spirituality. <br></p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting you.</p>

Lean Culture,"<p>Lean startup is a startup methodology which aims to reduce the market risks and minimize capital requirements by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.</p> 
<p>But while the lean startup methodology has become practically a gospel in the startup community, it is more honored&nbsp; in breach than in practice.</p> 
<p>Why is it so hard to be lean?</p> 
<p>Lean is humble; it requires admitting that you don't know your market as well as you imagine.</p> 
<p>Lean is frugal; it entails making do with less or even with virtually nothing.</p> 
<p>Lean is disciplined; it requires us to focus on areas that are not our natural forte.</p> 
<p>What can entrepreneurs do to foster a lean culture?</p> 
<p>1) Learn lean startup methodology.</p> 
<p>2) Practice lean startup methodology where you have control.</p>

We listen to recordings by Esther Hicks, then discuss and practice the techniques learned<span>.&nbsp; This material is from workshops led by ""Abraham"", a group of non-physical entities channeled through Esther.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>DAY-TIME-LOCATION-</strong><span> Celebrate LIFE! Progressive Spiritualist Community hosts an always upbeat group </span><strong>the 2nd, 4th and 5th Thursdays, 7:30-8:45pm,</strong><span> at 4530 18th Street, SF, CA 94114 (between Ord &amp; Douglas) If coming by car, allow time for parking. By Muni, the 33-Stanyan stops within one block, and the K, L, M &amp; T lines stop 5 blocks away at Castro Street Station.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>LOVE OFFERING-</strong><span>&nbsp;The suggested donation is $10-20, but no one is turned away for lack of funds. Your donations can be tax-deductible if we have record of you providing it (i.e. check or envelope made to CLSC). Your generosity is appreciated! Thank you!</span></p>
<p><strong>RSVP</strong> not required, but is encouraged as it inspires others to come and gives them an idea of who will be there!</p>
<p><strong>Are you new to Abraham Hicks Law of Attraction?</strong> If you're new to this subject, you will find a free downloadable version of ""<em>Ask and It Is Given""</em>, by Esther Hicks in this group's ""file"" area (located under the ""more"" button in the navigation bar).

Santa Cruz Meditation Group,"<p>Healthy minds dance for joy! Come celebrate and explore the experiences of a lifetime! Meditate, dance, shake, visualize , draw, and talk to keep your mind and body in good health. Find the skills that work for you! <br> <br>This is the place where you get to try out different experiences from the field of Mind-Body Medicine. Mind-Body Medicine is an up and coming integrative health perspective. It links our overall health to the connection between our mind and body. Most people talk about the benefits of Mind-Body Medicine as learning skills for good health. Its true benefit to you is having <span><strong>experiences</strong></span> which positively affect you. The experience of participating with this group will positively change your understanding. You won't know what you've been missing until you try it. Similar experiences improved my outlook on life a thousand fold! I am healthier than I've ever been, where it really counts! in my head! The impact of this positive change in my life and everyone around me has been astonishing. Care to be astonished? <br> <br>I wish I could say that meditation is the best way to start. Its how I started, its what I'm best at, and its how I got to be here. After seeing the experiences others have had by participating in Mind-Body exercises I have to say its not! Mind-Body exercises work faster and are more fun! Meditation is the purest mental exercise though and can become a wonderful part of your life as well. This group will engage you on many levels from dancing for joy to the deepest meditative experience. <br> <br>Yeh! <br> <br>Outside of being a genius with a passion for this stuff, who am I? Professionally I am a civil engineer with 19 years of experience. I've loved playing sports my whole life. I am very competitive and fair! I am not affiliated with any religion. Malyn, co-organizer, is my girlfriend, she works professionally as a pediatrician. In addition to our personal experience we have both received training through the Center of Mind Body Medicine in Washington DC. As I mentioned earlier, this training provides alternatives to meditation that can achieve similar results, sometimes even faster than meditation! <br> <br>Background <br> <br>Meditation is a label for many activities which are universal to humanity. Even the simple act of conversing with another person can be a meditative experience. Physical relaxation can also coincide with a meditative experience. When I talk about meditation it includes these types of introductory experiences and more advanced skills. I started this group because I've benefited enormously from meditating, and it all began unknowingly; I didn't know I was meditating! To be honest, I just wanted to be happy. I've discovered how to be happier, how to allow myself to be at my best without thinking about it. Everyone wants to know the answer, How? The secret is...this gritty stuff called emotions. Emotions are there to help us, not just some emotions, all of them. The more this is understood, the more beautiful life becomes. For many people, there are times emotions do not help, its these that can be transformed. Emotions are difficult to work with by their very nature. The group is intended to provide an environment to help you with these in the best possible way, have some fun, share some stories, relax, and also work through some of those emotions. Not me you might say? How can you afford the time? How can you not? What would you give to be happier every day for the rest of your life? I just wish I had figured this stuff out sooner! The goal is to create habitual positive experiences, as natural as brushing your teeth before you go to bed. The result? Living more beautifully with each passing day. <br> <br>Although I love to use positive words like happiness and beauty when thinking about this stuff, understand this isn't about focusing on being happy, to the detriment of your emotional range, sadness, anger, grief. Its about changing your perspective and experience of living, so that you experience the best possible emotion for the moment you are in. Its not about ignoring the past or the future but finding a way to understand them in new ways. Its by experiencing transformations of perspective personally that change happens. Again, the secret is not to study, but to experience. In this group, the goal is to have a range of transformational experiences, some will incrementally affect you almost without notice, others will be immediately life altering.

"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress","<p><span>Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?</span><br></p>
<p>This group can help.</p>
<p>I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.</p>
<p>The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. <br></p>
<p>If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.</p>
<p>Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.</p>
<p>Member-to-member Connections:&nbsp; In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.</p>
<p>Affiliation:&nbsp; I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp; I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.</p>
<p>Activities:&nbsp; We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.&nbsp; The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. <br></p>
<p>Interests:&nbsp; We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.</p>
<p>Membership requirement:&nbsp; Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.</p>
<p>Intention:&nbsp; My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.&nbsp; My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Depression', u'urlkey': u'depression', u'id': 1079}, {u'name': u'Divorce Support', u'urlkey': u'divorcesupport', u'id': 1570}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Life Transformation', u'urlkey': u'lifetransform', u'id': 8702}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Self-Help', u'urlkey': u'self-help', u'id': 16651}, {u'name': u'Stress Relief', u'urlkey': u'stress-relief', u'id': 17075}, {u'name': u'Marital Separation Support', u'urlkey': u'marital-separation', u'id': 17917}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness', u'id': 22543}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Depression and Panic', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-depression-and-panic', u'id': 41951}, {u'name': u'Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-support', u'id': 48057}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}]"

A Confidential Therapy Group for Women!,"<p>Welcome! This wonderful, confidential therapy group is facilitated by local clinical psychologist Carla Marie Manly, Ph.D. The group focuses on a variety of important issues such as low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and isolation. The group provides support and encouragement during life transitions such as divorce, relationship changes, and career changes. We work on setting and achieving personal goals within a positive, meaningful framework. The group provides a safe place for women of all ages to build their confidence, receive feedback, and find inner strength by sharing with other women in a safe and peaceful environment. This group also offers skill-building and strategies to help women cope with life stresses and challenges. This group is limited to 7 members and is ongoing on a weekly basis. The fee is $25.00 per session.</p>
<p>At the start of each group, each member has an opportunity to check in and discuss current challenges and concerns in a supportive and encouraging environment. We address a wide variety of important topics such as anxiety, depression, isolation, relationship concerns, and low self-esteem. Compassionate, therapeutic insights are offered to promote healing, self-awareness, and positive changes. We focus on understanding and utilizing practical strategies to improve self-confidence, coping skills, and interpersonal relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>As we move through various topics, you'll find that your inner awareness and strength grows. You will come away from each session with a better understanding of yourself and how you interact with others. You'll find encouragement in meeting with other women whose life experiences illuminate your own struggles. A sense of vital interconnection develops as you realize that your own insights and experiences also benefit others! The group discussions change as we move forward, and the themes will evolve naturally as life circumstances change.<em><strong>The ultimate goal is to help each woman create the joy-filled, passionate life of her dreams!</strong></em></p>

Bay Area Sound Healing Group,"<p>Resonant Harmony Attunements</p>
<p>The Resonant Harmony Attunements are designed for two purposes:</p>
<p>1. To Create Community Where We are All Connected &ndash; When you share sound together, everyone's whole system shares the same vibration or frequency -- brainwaves, heart rates, and electromagnetic fields align, and we all become like family. In fact, sharing sound together is a portal to remembering the ultimate state of where we are all One -- particularly when the sound ends and we enter that divine place of peace where we disappear. We believe this is the ultimate goal, Oneness -- for when we exist in a world where we are all one there is no more conflict, no more war -- and only love and light permeate all of our relationships. Coming together in sound creates this Community, where we are all connected, one with all humanity and life --including everything on the planet.</p>
<p>2. To Bring Us into Higher States of Consciousness &ndash; A Higher Frequency - There are two general types of states: <br />a. A State of Bliss &ndash; Defining &ldquo;Bliss&rdquo; as any high state of consciousness &ndash; including that of Gratitude, Compassion, Joy, and Love (personal and Universal). This state could be simply Perfect Presence or simply just a sweet state of Well Being. Of course, music often takes us to such a place. It is even more powerful when the underlying sounds are also working towards inducing the same state, and when you include a powerful Intention. <br />b. A State of Deep Peace &ndash; Not just silence (because silence can be uncomfortable), but a place of peace like no other. It happens when the sound ends on the root, home note of the song and fades ever so slowly -- seamlessly melding into the silence. When this happens the last frequency heard remains in the room &ndash; humming ever so still. The slower the fade, the better.</p>
<p><br />The Events include many different Experiences. Sometimes a night might be devoted to one particular type of experience; Often we will have multiple experiences in one night:</p>
<p>1. Sound Healing Concerts &ndash; Wide variety of groups based around Sound Healing and Raising Consciousnes.</p>
<p>2. Sound Journeys &ndash; Experience the healing and consciousness raising aspects of sound as you lay on the floor with your eyes closed. We play a wide range of natural sounds all around you, including using the voice to induce higher states of consciousness. The journeys often include Crystal Bowls and Tibetan Bowls.</p>
<p>3. Toning with Intention &ndash; Most of our meditations are done with a conscious stated Intention. It is well-known and has been proven through research that Intention really does work.</p>
<p>4. Chanting &ndash; Chanting songs from around the world. No singing experience required. We often do Kirtan (Call and response).</p>
<p>5. Sound Healing Music &ndash; Wide range of live and recorded Sounds and Music to bring you into a state of bliss and deep peace.</p>
<p>6. Sound and Movement &ndash; Taking sound into form in the body and throughout the chakras.</p>
<p>7. Guided Meditations with Sound &ndash; From releasing stuck emotions and energy to resonating higher forms of sound and light consciousness.</p>","[{u'name': u'Yoga', u'urlkey': u'yoga', u'id': 244}, {u'name': u'Metaphysics', u'urlkey': u'metaphysics', u'id': 774}, {u'name': u'Meditation', u'urlkey': u'meditation', u'id': 1322}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Energy Healing', u'urlkey': u'energy-healing', u'id': 15738}, {u'name': u'Chanting', u'urlkey': u'chanting', u'id': 15858}, {u'name': u'Sound Healing', u'urlkey': u'sound-healing', u'id': 16734}, {u'name': u'Alternative Medicine', u'urlkey': u'alternative-medicine', u'id': 17150}, {u'name': u'Crystal Bowls', u'urlkey': u'crystal-bowls', u'id': 23573}, {u'name': u'Sound Vibrational Healing', u'urlkey': u'sound-vibrational-healing', u'id': 40270}]"

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Earth Wisdom and The Michael Teachings Channeling Group,"<p><img src=""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/9/7/event_16852119.jpeg""></p>
<p><strong>WELCOME to EARTH WISDOM and THE MICHAEL TEACHINGS CHANNELING GROUP!</strong> <br> <br>Earth Wisdom and the Michael Teachings Open Channeling Group meets every other Wednesday in Santa Rosa for an alternating <strong>OPEN TOPIC</strong> format channeled meetup group, where any and all questions are welcome, and a <strong>TOPIC BASED</strong> format, which is chosen by the group members each month at the <strong>1st</strong> <strong>OPEN TOPIC</strong> meetup of the month. <br> <br>Both newbies to <b>The Michael Teachings</b> and seasoned Michael students are equally welcome and respected in this meetup group. </p>
<p><span>Please feel free to invite your friends to this group as well, if you wish. <em><strong>RSVP responses to the meetups are encouraged and are greatly appreciated</strong></em> so we will have a better idea of how people many to expect at each of our meetup groups. Thanks! :-) <br></span></p>
<p><span>Be sure to visit our <strong><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Earth-Wisdom-and-The-Michael-Teachings/messages/boards/"">DISCUSSION FORUM</a> </strong>between meetup groups for more information on The Michael Teachings, an excellent article on ""The History of Channeling"",&nbsp; inspirational quotes and messages, astrological forecasts, monthly trends and more.&nbsp; And, last but not least, please check out our <strong><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Earth-Wisdom-and-The-Michael-Teachings/calendar/"">CALENDAR</a></strong> for future meetup dates, times and locations, and for upcoming <strong>SPECIAL EVENTS</strong> that may be scheduled for this meetup group in the near future as well. <br> <br><strong><span>What Is This Meetup Group All About Anyway?</span></strong> <br> <br>This meetup group is based primarily upon the teachings of the ancient mid-causal plane entity teacher known simply as Michael, who was first popularized in the best-selling book, ""Messages from Michael"" by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro in the late 1970's. Many excellent books have since been published through numerous other Michael channels, adding depth, breadth and an ongoing evolution to the original channeled works. <br> <br>The Michael Teachings are a profoundly practical and directly applicable philosophy of life that sheds light upon the the nature of the self, one's relationships with others and on the workings underlying all life and the cosmos in general. It is a teaching designed for use and application on the physical plane, and is very grounded and geared to give each student a kind of map of the world from and through which they may more fully examine, evaluate and evolve their understanding of their own personal life experiences. <br> <br>A major part of Michael's teaching is concerned with reincarnation, its implications and ramifications. Part of this teaching is based upon a system of personality traits called ""overleaves"". Michael gave the information to increase our understanding of self and others, thereby improving the quality of life and relationships. Michael also intended the material be used to accelerate spiritual growth. <br> <br>This group is also based upon indigenous shamanic perspectives and practices from around the world, utilized in conjunction with the Michael Teachings perspective for an even deeper dive into the nature of your own personal reality and what makes YOU tick, from the inside, out. Working with our animal totems and learning about the traditional 9 Directions and the Michael Teachings 12 Support Circle functions are all included in the work I do with others both online and locally. <br> <br><strong>Who Is Michael?</strong> <br> <br>Michael is a collective consiousness comprised of approximately 1050 individual souls who have all completed their lifetimes on earth and have cycled off of the physical plane all together.&nbsp; They now teach as a recombined entity group from the causal plane perspective through various channels, bringing forth information to assist humanity along its spiritual path of life on the physical plane. <br> <br>Michael teaches that all is choice, that belief is not required, to test out and to question these teachings for yourself, and that personal validation of of one's own essence is the means by which humans progress themselves along the path of return to the Tao. Invalidation of essence serves only to retard and to inhibit such progress, according to Michael. The goal of these teachings is to develop an ever greater capacity for agage` and for unconditional love in our lives. They also offer their causal plane insights without expectation and with unconditional love and carry no expectations of their students, period. They simply offer insight as they see it and each person is free to use what they will and to discard the rest if it doesn't resonate or ring true for them personally.<em>&nbsp; (*Note: This entity group is NOT the Archangel Michael.)</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Who Would Enjoy Being Part of This Group? </strong> <br> <br>This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn more about themselves, their relationships with others, the underlying structure of life, the world in which we live and the universe in general.&nbsp; Bring yourself, your friends and your questions to an upcoming meetup and experience for yourself what this ancient, humorous and insightful causal plane teacher has to offer you along your own personal path of return to the Tao. <br> <br>I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you better through our regularly scheduled channeled meetup groups each month. Thank you for your interest in this group and I hope you will enjoy both the information and the comaraderie that you will find in our growing community. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about this group or any of the upcoming scheduled events. <br> <br>Best Blessings to you each and all, <br> <br>Warmly, Terri&nbsp; (aka: LadyHawk and EquuSpirit online)</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Metaphysics', u'urlkey': u'metaphysics', u'id': 774}, {u'name': u'Shamanism', u'urlkey': u'shamanism', u'id': 1254}, {u'name': u'Psychics', u'urlkey': u'psychics', u'id': 1523}, {u'name': u'Dreams', u'urlkey': u'dreams', u'id': 1586}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Consciousness', u'urlkey': u'consciousness', u'id': 4417}, {u'name': u'Michael Teachings', u'urlkey': u'michaelteachings', u'id': 8517}, {u'name': u'Reincarnation', u'urlkey': u'reincarnation', u'id': 8728}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Channeling', u'urlkey': u'channeling', u'id': 16069}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Psychology', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-psychology', u'id': 18507}, {u'name': u'Past Lives', u'urlkey': u'past-lives', u'id': 23184}, {u'name': u'Shamanic Journeying', u'urlkey': u'shamanic-journeying', u'id': 37511}, {u'name': u'Soul Retrieval', u'urlkey': u'soul-retrieval', u'id': 53071}, {u'name': u'Animal Totems', u'urlkey': u'animal-totems', u'id': 92417}]"

Adapt Foundation,"<p>The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.</p>
<p>We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.</p>
<p>There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.</p>
<p>The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you.

Pathwayslt/ChrisBeals Meditation Group S.F. Bay Area,"<p>All of Pathways' meditation classes are designed to empower you on your spiritual path. Classes cover a range of topics. The teaching method allows the student to integrate mind, body, spirit, and emotion simultaneously. Most people are integrated in two out of the four areas. This system will allow the student to move ahead in balance. Workshops are a great way to introduce your self to my work. I am currently teaching in Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek and San Mateo! Please join me for this fun and empowering work. I believe everyone is gifted, it is just a matter of developing and understanding your gifts. I teach active meditations that you can take home and use right away.&nbsp;</p>

Heart Chan Meditation - Bay Area & Silicon Valley Group,"<p>Heart Chan represents an unbroken line of teachings and teachers, traced back over 1500 years at Shaolin temple in China, where Master Bodhidharma, an enlightened Indian monk traveling all the way from India to central China to spread the teachings of Chan, integrated and harmonized it with various local practices that led generations of practitioners to clarity, truth, fulfillment, and inner peace.</p>
<p>We are a group of practitioners following the teachings of the 85th Patriarch of the School of Chan, who dedicated his entire life to enable us to also be able to walk the path towards enlightenment. Through sitting meditation, we can transcend the limitations of our body, our conscious and subconscious mind, and to become in sync with our heart and uncover the most natural expressions of compassion and joy in each and every moment of our lives.</p>
<p>We welcome all of you to join our practice, the journey becomes much easier when many people work together and help each other along the way.</p>

Family Constellations-East Bay Meet-Up,"This group is dedicated to the healing of the mind, body and spirit. Through constellation work participants can connect to their own ancestors. Participants can find resolution to the places in life that are stuck, whether this is with success, romantic relationships, family, career or finances. When the family system is a good order, love flows to us and success comes to us. When the family system is stuck, life can be a struggle. The family system can be tangled from any unresolved trauma from past generations, known or unknown to members of the family. Unresolved trauma could be a sibling that died in childhood, a parent that lost their parent at an early age, a grandfather surviving WWII. The unresolved trauma lives on in the family soul. This can block us from success, health, romantic relationships, career and finances we desire in life. If you are experiencing blocks that you can't associate to anything specific, Or if you are experiencing blocks that stems from an undefined sadness, this group may be for you. Find the deep peace and relief from family constellations.","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Law of Attraction', u'urlkey': u'lawofattraction', u'id': 3382}, {u'name': u'Leadership', u'urlkey': u'leadership', u'id': 15121}, {u'name': u'Family Constellations', u'urlkey': u'family-constellations', u'id': 15521}, {u'name': u'Energy Healing', u'urlkey': u'energy-healing', u'id': 15738}, {u'name': u'Positive Thinking', u'urlkey': u'positive-thinking', u'id': 16212}, {u'name': u'Life Coaching', u'urlkey': u'life-coaching', u'id': 18692}, {u'name': u'Family Systems', u'urlkey': u'family-systems', u'id': 22916}, {u'name': u'nonviolent communication', u'urlkey': u'nonviolent-communication', u'id': 38562}, {u'name': u'NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)', u'urlkey': u'nlp-neurolinguistic-programming', u'id': 43763}, {u'name': u'Conflict Resolution', u'urlkey': u'conflict-resolution', u'id': 47941}]"

Bay Area Liberating Structures Community of Practice,"<p>Our intent: </p>
<br>
<p>The Bay Area Liberating Structures Community of Practice exists to support the community of people getting started and scaling up their use of Liberating Structures. LS make tiny shifts in the way we meet, plan, organize and decide. By dramatically increasing both the number of people involved and their engagement in solving complex problems, LS reliably generate better-than-expected results. The simplicity of the LS repertoire enables them to play well with other methods like change management, Agile, Lean and Design Thinking. Drawing inspiration from complexity science, Keith McCandless and Henri Lipmanowicz have made the entire repertoire available for non-commercial use through a Creative Commons license.</p>

Santa Cruz Evening Toastmasters - Est. 1991,"<p><b>Toastmasters</b> is the world's leading public speaking and leadership development program. Our <b>Evening Toastmasters Live Oak, Santa Cruz, California</b> meets every <b>Monday EVENING at 6:30PM</b>. <br></p>
<p>Our members DO NOT have to wake up at the crack of dawn to enjoy all that Toastmasters offers. <br></p>
<p>Most people associate the name Toastmasters with public speaking improvement training, but did you know that public speaking is only HALF of what we offer? <br></p>
<p><b>The Evening Toastmasters offers two parallel self improvement programs: </b> <br></p>
<p><b>Competent Communicator</b> - 10 standard projects which will incrementally improve and fine tune your presentation skills. You may move through your projects at your own comfortable pace. <br></p>
<p><b>Competent Leadership</b> - Ten Leadership projects which will improve and fine tune your listening and management skills. You can become a polished and more effective manager, business leader or entrepreneur at your own pace. <br></p>
<p><b>Evening Toastmasters</b> is a well established club having its beginnings in 1991. Founded by <b>Dan Robin</b>, <b>Steve Hardy</b> (still an active member) and a few others, including <b>Jim Griffin</b> from the <b>SCO Club</b> in Santa Cruz. Our club started at a little library room in Santa Cruz, and has now grown to occupy a very comfortable space in the <b>Live Oak Senior's Center at 1777 Capitola Road, Santa Cruz, CA 95062. </b> <br></p>
<p><b>Plenty of free parking and only a short walk from your car to our front door. <br></b></p>
<p>Enough about us, let's talk about<b> YOU! <br></b></p>
<p><b>What are YOUR personal improvement goals? </b> <br></p>
<p>Do you want to apply for an <b>advancement at work</b> which will require presentation skills? <br></p>
<p>Are you thinking of <b>starting your own company</b> and need to obtain funding? <br></p>
<p>Are you working at a non-profit and <b>need to apply for grant money</b> by making a powerful presentation? <br></p>
<p>Maybe you would like to feel more <b>comfortable in social settings.</b></p>
<p><b>Friend's wedding </b>coming up? Be the <b>Toastmaster</b> of that very special event!</p>
<p><b>We have helped our members achieve these goals and more. We WILL help YOU get there! </b> <br></p>
<p>You <b>have FRIENDS here</b> whom you haven't met yet!!! Our members are from all walks of life. Our ages range from twenty something to seventy something wonderful! <br></p>
<p>Our club is very proud of our award winning history! We have been awarded Presidential Distinguished at least 3 times, and Select Distinguished several times over. <br></p>
<p>We have very active and experienced leadership. We have a well organized Mentorship program in our club. New members may choose to buddy up with an experienced member to ""learn the ropes"" as it were. Your mentor will provide as much personal guidance as you request. Then, when you are ready, you may become a Mentor and help one or more of the next group on their way to reaching their personal goals. <br></p>
<p>Now here's something we have not mentioned... <b>do you like to LAUGH and have FUN?</b></p>
<p>Our members <b>LOVE to laugh and have FUN! </b>We love to entertain and to be entertained! We are sometimes completely spontaneous and goofy!!! <br></p>

Lodi Toastmasters Meetup,"<p>Toastmasters is a place where you develop and grow - both personally and professionally. You join a community of learners, and in Toastmasters meetings we learn by doing. Whether you're an executive or a stay-at-home parent, a college student or a retiree, you will improve yourself; building skills to express yourself in a variety of situations. You'll open up a world of new possibilities: giving better work presentations; leading meetings - and participating in them - more confidently; speaking more smoothly off the cuff; even handling one-on-one interactions with family, friends and colleagues more positively. Anyone who is a strong leader has to first be an effective communicator. In Toastmasters you will hone your speaking skills, and you will develop leadership abilities - through evaluations, listening, mentoring, serving as club officers and filling roles in club meetings. You will take those leadership skills out into the world, running businesses, mentoring youths, organizing fund-raisers, coaching teams and heading up families. By learning to effectively formulate, organize and express your ideas to others, you can achieve all kinds of success. You'll be more capable and confident when giving presentations. You'll be more persuasive when pitching prospective clients. Want to be better at negotiating your salary with your boss? Networking at business or social functions? Motivating co-workers - or your kids? We welcome you to join us at Lodi Toastmasters</p>

Corporate Leadership Development Meetup,"<p>Hello potential leaders,</p> 
<p>This is a group for you if you would like to develop your leadership skills. Transitioning from senior management of a company to leadership is not an easy transition. What I found is that to make the transition successfully, executives must navigate a tricky set of changes in their leadership focus and skills. They must learn to move from specialist to generalist, analyst to integrator, tactician to strategist, problem solver to agenda setter, warrior to diplomat.</p> 
<p>The agenda for this group would be to help each other through this transition. We would do that by sharing our experiences and learnings in the organizations we work for. This group is idea for those who are in management roles and would like to pursue leadership opportunities (VP, SVP, EVP, C-suite). This group is also for those who are in leadership roles and would like to grow further into those roles. Although age is no bar, it would be best if we target folks in 30s and early 40s age group. We would meet regularly and exchange ideas, information. I would like to get suggestions from group members as to what the agenda/activity for meetups should be. At my end, I transitioned into a leadership role recently. I woul be glad to share my experiences with the group and help those who would like to transition into leadership roles.</p>","[{u'name': u'Professional Development', u'urlkey': u'prodev', u'id': 3880}, {u'name': u'Leadership', u'urlkey': u'leadership', u'id': 15121}, {u'name': u'Business Strategy', u'urlkey': u'business-strategy', u'id': 17635}, {u'name': u'Leadership Development', u'urlkey': u'leadership-development', u'id': 19539}, {u'name': u'Business Leadership', u'urlkey': u'business-leadership', u'id': 34474}, {u'name': u'Leadership skills', u'urlkey': u'leadership-skills', u'id': 92342}]"

Gold Star Referral Clubs Sacramento NOW Forming,"<p>Gold Star Referral Clubs are professional networking groups for local business people wanting to grow their business through referrals.</p> 
<p>The primary goal of the group is to build quality relationships, give solid referrals, and to support and learn from each other. This is done through weekly meetings and short, individual 1-to-1's where members learn more about each other's businesses &amp;amp; needs.</p> 
<p>Each meeting follows a purposeful agenda geared toward bringing more business our members. Each Gold Star Member shares a 60-Second Infomercial about their products and services with the group. Guests are encouraged to share as well, provided there is no Member in the same business category. Each meeting also includes a 10-minute business presentation by a group member, which is scheduled in advance. This lets members share about their products &amp;amp; services, business philosophy and what makes them unique from the competition in a friendly, group setting.</p> 
<p>Members are encouraged to attend the other Gold Star Groups in our area (we call this Cross Clubbing) where they can make additional connections and share their business during 60-second infomercials, provided there is no member in the same category.</p>

South Bay Positive Psychology Salon,"<p>We all want to be happy, right? Are you interested in learning about what we know about thriving and achieving lasting happiness? Do you like the idea of exploring and achieving your full potential as a human being? Would you like to learn how to experience flow states and become more resilient in the face of life's obstacles?</p>
<p>If so, this is the right group for you! Each week Julie will lead a group discussion about a topic in positive psychology and personal development. This group is a place to learn how to thrive and also teach each other the methods that have worked for you. Positive psychology has three foundational areas of development: positive emotions, positive traits, and positive community engagement. * Positive emotions lead to a pleasant life experience. Germaine to this are things like development of contentment with your past, happiness in the here and now, and hope for your future. *Developing your positive individual traits will help you to lead a more engaged life and experience flow states (which are awesome!). To experience more of this we will explore our strengths and virtues, such as our capacity to love and be productive, and our potential to develop our full potential to be courageous, compassionate, resilient, creative, curious, in integrity, self-knowledgable, moderate, self-controlled, and wise. *Using our strengths to benefit our community and the world gives life meaning and purpose. We can develop our potential in this area by studying what meaning and purpose mean to us as individuals and how we can strive to use our strengths to improve our communities through our efforts in such areas as as social justice, personal responsibility, kindness &amp; compassion, parenting, nurturance of others, modeling a strong work ethic, developing out leadership abilities, promoting teamwork, building purpose, and sharing tolerance.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you and working together to discover where our potential can lead us!</p>

Santa Cruz Area Software Development Leadership Meetup,"<p>Leaders in Software Development (Team Leads, Development Managers, Program Managers, Directors, etc.) face unique challenges. Many of us have been successful as Software Engineers and have strong opinions about code and structure. We may strive to balance the ideal of self-driven teams with product delivery. Some (or many) of us may struggle with how deeply to dive into new technologies versus delegate detailed learning to team members.</p> 
<p>This is a group for those in the Santa Cruz area interested in exploring the challenges of Software Development Leadership. This group is intended for people who are currently performing some level of leadership in software development, and those interested in moving into a role encompassing more leadership. Initially, I envision getting together with folks who are interested in discussing their challenges and offering experience and ideas. Depending on the size and interest, we could also have more formal meetings with presentations on specific subjects.</p>","[{u'name': u'Software Development', u'urlkey': u'softwaredev', u'id': 3833}, {u'name': u'Technology', u'urlkey': u'technology', u'id': 10579}, {u'name': u'Leadership', u'urlkey': u'leadership', u'id': 15121}, {u'name': u'Agile Project Management', u'urlkey': u'agile-project-management', u'id': 21549}]"

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,"<p>We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person. <br> However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'. <br> And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.</p>
<p>According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.</p>
<p>This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.</p>
<p>T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).</p>
<p>Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....</p>
<p>This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.</p>
<p>We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.</p>
<p>Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.</p>
<p>You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.<span><br></span></p>

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,"<p>This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! <b>Visit <a href=""http://eatlikeagoddess.com"">Eat LIke A Goddess now</a> for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body.</b></p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Law of Attraction', u'urlkey': u'lawofattraction', u'id': 3382}, {u'name': u'Nutrition', u'urlkey': u'nutrition', u'id': 10161}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Weight Loss Challenge', u'urlkey': u'weight-loss-challenge', u'id': 14998}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Weight Loss Support', u'urlkey': u'weight-loss-support', u'id': 15538}, {u'name': u'Healthy Eating', u'urlkey': u'healthy-eating', u'id': 19630}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'EFT for Stress Reduction/Release', u'urlkey': u'eft-for-stress-reduction-release', u'id': 43689}, {u'name': u'EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)', u'urlkey': u'eft-emotional-freedom-technique', u'id': 58052}, {u'name': u'Healthy Weight Loss', u'urlkey': u'healthy-weight-loss', u'id': 58776}]"

Exploring the Tools of Energy Psychology to Change Your Life,"<p>Energy Psychology (EP) consists of a number of holistic modalities that use a mind-body-spirit approach to healing. The premise is that any illness or dis-ease has physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components and that all of them need to be addressed for deep and complete healing to occur. On a basic level, everything is made of energy, including our bodies, so when imbalances or blockages in the energy flow occur they can result in any number of issues or problems, such as stress, anxiety, depression and more. EP tools are designed to identify and remove those blockages so that the body-mind-spirit can heal itself.</p>
<p>This group is for those seeking more information about healing using these innovative tools. Some of them can be used for self-healing, others are for working with a therapist or other health professional. My intention is to provide an overview of what's out there beyond the traditional tools of western psychology, open to anyone who's interested.</p>

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,"<p>Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we<span>&nbsp;do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel&nbsp;dispirited&nbsp;by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion).</span></p>","[{u'name': u'Panic Disorders', u'urlkey': u'panicdisorders', u'id': 1939}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u'Social Anxiety', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety', u'id': 18575}, {u'name': u'Anxiety, Panic Disorder', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-panic-disorder', u'id': 22886}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia', u'id': 45298}, {u'name': u'Social Phobia Support', u'urlkey': u'social-phobia-support', u'id': 45899}, {u'name': u'Mental Illness Awareness', u'urlkey': u'mental-illness-awareness', u'id': 55711}, {u'name': u'Behavioral & Mental Health', u'urlkey': u'behavioral-mental-health', u'id': 61982}, {u'name': u'overcoming shyness', u'urlkey': u'overcoming-shyness', u'id': 71641}, {u'name': u'Building Friendships', u'urlkey': u'building-friendships', u'id': 81925}, {u'name': u'Support Group for Panic & Anxiety Disorder', u'urlkey': u'support-group-for-panic-anxiety-disorder', u'id': 107160}, {u'name': u'Social anxiety support group', u'urlkey': u'social-anxiety-support-group', u'id': 138848}, {u'name': u'Anxiety in Social Settings', u'urlkey': u'anxiety-in-social-settings', u'id': 447752}, {u'name': u'Self Help & Self Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-help-self-improvement', u'id': 1506756}]"

Ladies Meet over a Meal,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>There are so many of us out here in the San Francisco and Bay Area; we all have different interests, different backgrounds and skills, as well as different preferences in what we eat.  Since I love eating and figure many others do too, I thought it would be fun to use the lunch hours to bring us all together.  Whether you want to try new restaurants, meet some new, exciting, and different people, or simply just build your connections... I invite you to join us for some of our lunches.  Most lunches would be in restaurants around the downtown, north beach, and financial district area during the weekdays.  Right now, I am looking into Fridays, but feel free to give me suggestions of restaurants or days that may work better for you. <br />Look forward to meeting many of you!</p>

Sacramento Business Social Network Group,"<p><strong>LOOKING TO GENERATE MORE REFERRAL BUSINESS?</strong><br>

<br>

The Sacramento Business Social Network Group is a local community of business owners and professionals whose members actively work to refer and generate business for one another.<br>

<br>

Through regular meetings and activities our members help you find new clients and grow your business.<br>

<br>

<strong>WHAT IS A SOCIAL NETWORK GROUP? HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong><br>

<br>

We are primarily a group of business people looking to meet new clients and referral sources during social events. We have found that quick meet and greet style networking events are not nearly as effective as creating long lasting relationships with other professionals. We are committed to building a strong core of 30-40 regular attendees with a constant ebb and flow of new-comers to meet.</p>
<p>Business types represented include: realtors, mortgage brokers, contractors, web designers, consultants, financial planners, accountants, software developers, recruiters, HR consultants, business development professionals, CPAs, corporate trainers, carpet cleaners, landscapers, architects, attorneys, chiropractors and countless others. These members work to actively cross-refer and refer business to one another in their daily communications with customers and prospects.</p>

Whether you'd like to expand your social network, are new in the area and want to meet potential friends, or you just want to sit back and enjoy some much needed girlfriend time, this group may be just perfect for you. Monthly meet ups include casual dinners, happy hours, brunch, movies, hiking, bowling, etc. will be set up for all of us to unwind, take a break from everyday drama, and just enjoy each other's company.

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Creative Circle', u'urlkey': u'creativecircle', u'id': 10447}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Family Constellations', u'urlkey': u'family-constellations', u'id': 15521}, {u'name': u""Women's Circle"", u'urlkey': u'womens-circle', u'id': 17276}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Growth', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-growth', u'id': 17658}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Transformation', u'urlkey': u'transformation', u'id': 21591}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Expressive Arts', u'urlkey': u'expressive-arts', u'id': 53903}, {u'name': u'Sacred Ceremony and Ritual', u'urlkey': u'sacred-ceremony-and-ritual', u'id': 59894}, {u'name': u""Women's Support"", u'urlkey': u'womens-support', u'id': 144477}]"

We will alternate between lunch events and evening happy hours. &nbsp;At the lunches, there will be time for networking and everyone will have a short time to introduce yourself and your business. The evening events are an informal time to get to know each other and our businesses in a less structured format.

Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

FEMININE PROSPERITY Meetup Group,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>I created this group because I have found that women thrive when they are an integral part of a loving, supportive, emotionally healthy community.</p>
<p>We've heard many spiritual teachers, and now scientists as well, telling us that we really do create our own reality. But we have been programmed from our earliest years with lies about who we are and what we are capable of doing and being. In order to reverse that programming from our parents, our schools, our media and our entire society, we need a lot of support. We need a community consisting of loving people who take 100% responsibility for their lives and challenge you to do the same. We need a clear system to follow which teaches us how to dance with the Law of Attraction in a way that really works. Through exciting, transformational events, supportive meetings and fun activities, we are committed to keeping our vibration HIGH as much of the time as possible. Feeling wonderful, laughing, loving, creating ordinary miracles attracts more of the same! Come join us on our wild joyride!</p>

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,"<p>This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! <b>Visit <a href=""http://eatlikeagoddess.com"">Eat LIke A Goddess now</a> for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body.</b></p>","[{u'name': u'Fitness', u'urlkey': u'fitness', u'id': 242}, {u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Law of Attraction', u'urlkey': u'lawofattraction', u'id': 3382}, {u'name': u'Nutrition', u'urlkey': u'nutrition', u'id': 10161}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Weight Loss Challenge', u'urlkey': u'weight-loss-challenge', u'id': 14998}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Weight Loss Support', u'urlkey': u'weight-loss-support', u'id': 15538}, {u'name': u'Healthy Eating', u'urlkey': u'healthy-eating', u'id': 19630}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'EFT for Stress Reduction/Release', u'urlkey': u'eft-for-stress-reduction-release', u'id': 43689}, {u'name': u'EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique)', u'urlkey': u'eft-emotional-freedom-technique', u'id': 58052}, {u'name': u'Healthy Weight Loss', u'urlkey': u'healthy-weight-loss', u'id': 58776}]"

<p><br></p>
<p>We are Positive and wise women over the age of 45 who want to get together and share some fun, authentic and amazing times together.&nbsp; Hopefully in the process we will be making some life long friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a group of women that get together during the weekdays for lunches, happy hours, movies, walks, wine tasting and whatever else sounds interesting. Some of us work, some of us are retired and some of us are trying to figure what the next chapter is going be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are Not a group promoting our business. &nbsp;Please do that elsewhere, as I want to keep this group strictly as a way for us women to share activities together and hopefully build incredible friendships in the process.&nbsp;</p>

Dream Priestess(TM) Circle - Bay Area Women,"<p><span>The Dream Priestess(TM) Circle is a women's gathering where you can explore everyday magic. You will awaken and deepen your spiritual gifts (e.g. intuition), step into your spiritual power as a leader, and play with new ways of accessing spiritual guidance.</span> <br></p>
<p>Whether you're experienced with your spiritual gifts, or just discovering you have them, join us for creative exploration and fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatherings are at my home and there's room for about 10 women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

The San Francisco LGBT Professionals,"<p><span>There is a need for events with pre-screened professionals, in settings that facilitate social interaction, and provide entertainment in an organized manner in the San Francisco Bay Area. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As professionals we recognize the value of these events, and the costs involved. &nbsp;Therefore this is a PAID group, of $5 per month, which we encourage to be paid quarterly ($15), or yearly ($45). &nbsp;This does NOT cover our costs, but helps pay fees to MeetUp and weeds out people who join many groups, but never participate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dues can be paid via Meetup (WePay) or in person with cash or credit card (Square).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We do require members (1) give their real name (at least first name), (2) an appropriate picture of themselves in their profile (suitable for recognizing you at events), (3) regularly attend events and be involved with the group, (4) pay dues. </span></p>
<p><span>Events are organized based on member interest and feedback. &nbsp;Please be sure to fill out the Poll Questions to participate.</span><br></p>
<p><span>We ask you pay for guests you bring to events (fees will be posted).</span></p>

<p>Our meetings are a space for open and respectful discussions of different viewpoints. Sometimes discussions stay strictly on the texts; other times, readings lend themselves to more personal discussions.

<p>On readings: we tend to alternate between shorter readings (articles, short stories, essays, etc.) and longer pieces (books, plays, graphic novels, etc.). Care is taken to select readings that represent a broad range of genres, subjects, schools of thought, written by folks of varying backgrounds. We have a list of possible books, articles, etc., to read--please add to it&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Feminist-Book-Club/pages/Book_List_-_please_add_your_own%21"">here</a>&nbsp;or PM your friendly neighborhood moderator with suggestions!</p>
<p><span>RSVP's for individual book meetup events will be closed at 25 to make sure they stay small enough that everyone who wishes to has a chance to speak. We have strictly social meetups (no reading, just chatting and often booze) about once a month, and occasionally we meetup for other relevant events (talks, movies, etc.). Ideas for movies/plays/happy hour spots/ etc. are welcome! Members are also encouraged to host events that interest them. Ping me for details!&nbsp;</span> <br></p>

Peninsula Feminist Book Club,"<p>Hello Feminists,</p>
<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>

Global Poverty and Hunger Alleviation - Art and Action,"<p>This is a group for anyone interested in global poverty and hunger alleviation. Global Poverty and Hunger is the world's biggest solvable problem. No one can do this alone. We need everyone's help - whether you're a single person interested helping out, a couple, a small group, or a large organization. Everyone is welcome. If you're an organization with similar mission to ours -- let's join forces and become even stronger together! We'll work to change the world, one step at a time. We're going to be doing a combination of education, advocacy, and fundraising, as well as mobilization of action through community organizing and involvement of the arts. We'll teach about the subject in classrooms. We'll have Lunch and Learns benefitting the United Nations World Food Program USA. We'll meet with our congress members to advocate. We'll petition. We'll have an arts component, using Dance and Film among other mediums of art to raise awareness of global hunger. We'll host Dance performance showcases to fundraise -- <br>using Dance from all over the world as a way to create a collaborative voice in partnership with those in developing countries and to give light to those who face hunger and poverty in their daily lives. We'll create short films and feature films to raise awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I absolutely admire all the help that charities do to help communities struggling to overcome natural disaster, conflict and poverty. I do believe that countries in poverty must learn to support and sustain themselves in the long run, in addition to receiving emergency aid. Therefore, we'll also focus on programs fostering sustainability, helping communities build vital infrastructure to feed themselves. We'll aim to help communities with organization to stand up for their rights as well in order to mobilize change. Sounds like something you want to do?

<p>Everyone who is interested in learning about, talking about and/or meeting people who care about feminism and gender equity is welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that each of us will have a different perspective to add to discussions. No one person's opinion or perspective is the ""right"" one. We recognize that hearing different perspectives will add to our own pool of knowledge.</p>
<p>The books we read are resources. We also talk about other subjects related to feminism and gender equity.</p>
<p>This is also a place where you can share your radical ideas. When a member wants to share an idea or observation that feels vulnerable to share, &nbsp;that member can ask beforehand to be listened to only. Other members then will not share their different opinions at that time and instead be a witness to the courage of that member.</p>

<p>If you also like happy hours and brunch, and discussing current events/social justice (and maybe even discussing current events/social justice over happy hour or brunch), we'll probably do some of that too!</p>
<p>Hikes will take place primarily in Marin, Peninsula, East and South Bay. &nbsp;All skill levels welcome.</p>

SoOakland Collective,"<p>Hello, I am Shayla Jamerson. Founder of SoOakland. A organization I started 2 years ago to change the perspective of how Black Oakland was viewed. I created events that are safe spaces for the Black and Brown community as well as the natives. As a native of Oakland its disheartening what is happening int he city as far as gentrification is concerned. I appreciate the face lift that is happening but I do not appreciate people not being able to feel like this is home anymore. Anyways my group allows us to come together, network, have fun, travel, party, find out what other dope things are happening in the Bay Area, join forces, appreciate each others value through brotherhood and sisterhood experiences.

"Civil Rights History Discussion Group, SF","<p>In this group we'll dive deep into the many dimensions of the struggle for racial justice in twentieth-century America, and we'll have a helluva lot of fun while we do it! Over drinks, each month we'll discuss something fascinating from the spectrum of racial justice history - armed resistance; nonviolence; profound strategy; successes and failures; deep context; multiracial alliance building; nefarious tactics of divisiveness; histories of whiteness and structural and strategic racism; radical women and powerful youth; the profound legacy of LGBT figures in black and brown freedom struggles; grassroots mobilizations... This will be all about learning deeply about important issues, while having excellent conversations and building community. <br></p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The Structure</p>
<p>- This will be about everyone's voice being present, as long as they wish it to be... about everyone being able to express their ideas, ask their questions, be fully heard, and engage in meaningful dialog. There will be a facilitator, but we should practice the good ol' step up/step back. <br></p>
<p>- The readings each month will be somewhere between 10 to 20 pages; so it will be very accessible to folks with busy lives.&nbsp; However, it will be deep.&nbsp; Please read the material if you plan on attending.&nbsp; If you start but don't quite make it through, no worries, please come! <br></p>
<p>- As you read, think of these three things: What parts of the story most interest you? Is there anything you feel confusion about or want more clarity around? Are their connections you can draw between the story and the present moment? Considering these three things as you read will ensure especially awesome conversations! <br></p>
<p>- If the struggle for racial justice is something you have deep knowledge about and feel absolutely comfortable talking about, bring your wisdom! If this subject is new to you and it feels super heavy and you feel a little uneasy talking about it but you know its important and you want to figure it out, this is the perfect place for you too!&nbsp; We'll help you build up your knowledge and develop your voice, and we'll have fun.&nbsp; Let's make this a space for helping one another along the path; wherever we are on the path. <br></p>

The Magic Money Tree Project,"<p>What most people know about money is wrong and this is creating massive societal problems.&nbsp; The goal of the Magic Money Tree Project is to build grassroots literacy of political economics (how political and economic systems interact).&nbsp; We create, share, and disseminate educational tools and materials to build literacy on key societal issues.&nbsp; We work on a grassroots level to understand the issues real people face in their daily lives.

Wicca Wimmin's Moon Ritual of Marin,"<p>Blessed Be Sister! This is a Wiccan Full Moon Ritual of Pagan Goddess Worship for women, to celebrate our femininity and nurture our souls.

We will call in the four directions, invoke the Goddess, join our energies and raise up the cone of power to bless the world, each other, the cauldron and ourselves. The Ritual is very inclusive and you may bring things to put on the altar, or put in the cauldron to be blessed. Bring your drums and magic tools, and anything that honors the Goddess, wimmin, and your natural yin. This is a celebration of our womanhood, free of the male dynamic, for our spirits to be strengthened in total safety, &nbsp;and our souls healed. Join and enjoy as we honor each other's natural womanhood, to consciously align our selves with Mother Nature's cycles. The Full Moon energy is for fullfillment of life, love, health and all goodness. Ritual is followed by a vegetarian pot luck.</p>

The Temple holds monthly open rituals and annual celebrations for womyn and girls in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br></p>

From Laka to Artemis, Baba Yaga to Bast, Lakshmi to Yemaya, we celebrate the wisdom of all Goddesses and Ancestors. Some of us are just now discovering Her, others have been practicing deep magick in Her name for more than 30 years. But even those who have danced with Goddess for decades will find plenty to feed their hearts and minds. <br></p>
<p>All womyn and girls are encouraged to participate in the facilitation and development of the Temple if they feel called. Our behind the scenes group, <a href=""http://www.daughtersofthegoddess.com/kokua.html"">Kokua</a> , is for those womyn and girls who are dedicated to deepening and manifesting the mission of Daughters of the Goddess.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.daughtersofthegoddess.com""></a></p>

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening. &nbsp;With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment. &nbsp; As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.</p>
<p>HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.</p>
<p>This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.</p>
<p>I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.</p>
<p>On <strong>FRIDAY EVENING </strong>before every one day &nbsp;Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE INTEGRATION</strong> is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives. &nbsp;For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.</p>

Women's Circles and Events,"<p><span><strong>This group has two goals:</strong> Have a place for women who are drawn to sitting in circle with other women and / or women looking to participate in women only groups for spiritual growth, self exploration and transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Women have come together in ritual, healing and celebration for millennia. I deeply trust the healing power that occurs when we gather as women and share our stories. As well as when we engage in processes of deep transformation together. Some of the ways I offer this to the community in my work is through: women's circles, expressive arts groups, Holotropic Breathwork as well as retreats and other events</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Some of our</strong></span> <span><span><strong>m</strong></span><strong>eet ups are closed circles for those who enroll in the full nine week process (you can miss two of the 9 weeks). If this is not what you are looking for this time, we will keep you informed of other future women's events. we do have sometimes new and full open and free circles for women to get a taste of this work. <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>My intention in my groups</strong> is to create a sacred and supportive space for women to dive deep within, and find new places of opening, expression and resting in the integration of all of who they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the circle, Mujeres, Altares y Milagritos we will explore the lineage of the women th</span>at came before us as the core inquiry:</span></p>
<ul> 
 <p><span><strong>What were the messages and stories we received from them?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How have they informed and formed who we are ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What are places of release and which of honoring ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>How do we integrate these messages so they enrich our live story ?</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>What is your own unique voice and story ?</strong></span></p> 
</ul>
<p><span>In this group we will use of the expressive arts, circling with other women, altar and ritual, as powerful exploratory, empowering and integrative tools.</span></p>
<p><span>These groups are for women who are looking to find a supportive and inspiring space with other women, with the purpose of deep transformation, playfulness and a sacred space that will hold the various colors of the inner process. As well as produce lasting insights, change and growth in their lives.</span></p>","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Creative Circle', u'urlkey': u'creativecircle', u'id': 10447}, {u'name': u'Women Entrepreneurs', u'urlkey': u'women-entrepreneurs', u'id': 15497}, {u'name': u'Family Constellations', u'urlkey': u'family-constellations', u'id': 15521}, {u'name': u""Women's Circle"", u'urlkey': u'womens-circle', u'id': 17276}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Growth', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-growth', u'id': 17658}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Transformation', u'urlkey': u'transformation', u'id': 21591}, {u'name': u'Professional Women', u'urlkey': u'professional-women', u'id': 26273}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Expressive Arts', u'urlkey': u'expressive-arts', u'id': 53903}, {u'name': u'Sacred Ceremony and Ritual', u'urlkey': u'sacred-ceremony-and-ritual', u'id': 59894}, {u'name': u""Women's Support"", u'urlkey': u'womens-support', u'id': 144477}]"

Women Gone Wild Adventures,"<p><span>While we love our men and our guy friends, experiencing the outdoors with a group of women is a different game.</span></p>

<p><span>We believe in a caring and nurturing community, where all women are free to be themselves - safe to admit their weaknesses, safe to take on new challenges, and safe to explore the boundaries of life without men.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in fostering the independent, strong woman inside of every one of us.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe in having a damn good time whether it's ""roughing it"" in a fabulous mountain house and hitting up the spa, or car camping and checking out the local hot springs, or 10-days in the backcountry without a shower.</span></p>

Santa Cruz Women Hiking,"<p>Dear fellow hikers or potential hikers,</p>
<p>I love hiking in the fresh air of mountain and sea, and want to join with other women in exploring hiking trails in Santa Cruz and neighboring counties. My goal is to get good exercise, enjoy good company, and experience the serenity and inspiration of the great outdoors.</p>
<p>Most of the hikes I will organize will be in the 3- to 7- mile range with a gain of 200 to 2000 feet. &nbsp;There are other organizers, however, who may do longer and/or more difficult hikes. If you're not ready to do the longer steeper hikes, try the easier ones! You are also welcome to come and do a portion of a hike, then return on your own. That's how I got started!</p>
<p>This group is for women of any age, who love hiking in beautiful natural spaces, or who would like to give it a try! It's also a relaxed and easy way to make new friends :)</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the group or the hikes, feel free to send me an email.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Kitty</p>
<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>
<p>I will do my best to describe the level of difficulty of each hike, so you can decide if the hike is right for you. I'll use the descriptions below to indicate how much uphill there is. In addition to the uphill, please take into consideration how long the hike is. A hike may be described as moderately easy, but if it's 6 or 7 miles long, that distance may be too much for you at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Moderately easy</strong> = Up and down, but total elevation gain of less than 400 feet. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> = Total gain 400 to 800 feet. Lots of up and down. Can be steep stretches, but no really long steep uphill stretches. <br></p>
<p><strong>Moderately difficult</strong> = Total gain greater than 800 feet. May be some really steep sections and/or very long stretches of uphill. <br></p>","[{u'name': u'Hiking', u'urlkey': u'hiking', u'id': 638}, {u'name': u'Wellness', u'urlkey': u'wellness', u'id': 10306}, {u'name': u'Outdoors', u'urlkey': u'outdoors', u'id': 15046}, {u'name': u""Women's Fitness"", u'urlkey': u'womens-fitness', u'id': 15123}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Healthy Living', u'urlkey': u'healthy-living', u'id': 20221}, {u'name': u'Exercise', u'urlkey': u'excercise', u'id': 25375}]"

Wicca Wimmin's Moon Ritual of Marin,"<p>Blessed Be Sister! This is a Wiccan Full Moon Ritual of Pagan Goddess Worship for women, to celebrate our femininity and nurture our souls. This Sister Circle loosely follows Starhawk's style in her book The Spiral Dance. We will call in the four directions, invoke the Goddess, join our energies and raise up the cone of power to bless the world, each other, the cauldron and ourselves. The Ritual is very inclusive and you may bring things to put on the altar, or put in the cauldron to be blessed. Bring your drums and magic tools, and anything that honors the Goddess, wimmin, and your natural yin. This is a celebration of our womanhood, free of the male dynamic, for our spirits to be strengthened in total safety, &nbsp;and our souls healed. Join and enjoy as we honor each other's natural womanhood, to consciously align our selves with Mother Nature's cycles. The Full Moon energy is for fullfillment of life, love, health and all goodness. Ritual is followed by a vegetarian pot luck.</p>

Girl Develop It San Jose,"<p>Women Developers and Programmers!<br>

 Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.</p>
<p><br>

 It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask ""stupid questions.""</p>
<p><br>

 We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).</p>

Embodied Voice for Relationships,"<p>If you want more depth in your relationships, this is the right group for you. Whether you are in a partnership right now or you're single, come and learn how to create an even deeper level of intimacy in all the relationships in your life. This includes professional relationships, friendships, family dynamics and anything in between.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cornerstone to every relationship is communication and communication starts by using your voice to communicate your needs and desires. The problem is, most people don't know how to use their voice effectively, so even when you say exactly what you want, your partner doesn't hear you. Frustrating when that happens, isn't it? What would it be like if you could communicate your desires clearly and effectively <b>and</b>&nbsp;have your partner fulfill those desires? That is not only possible, we're here to show you how you can create this reality in your life.</p>
<p>Learning to speak from your body allows you not only to be heard - you will be felt in a way you have probably never experienced before. Learn how to use your voice to attract and keep the relationships you desire in your life. Find your authentic voice, and notice how much different it sounds than the way you currently sound when you speak. Feel the power of your own voice in a way you have yet to experience. Isn't it time for you to create the amazing relationships you have always wanted? Join us, and make these dreams a reality.</p>","[{u'name': u'Self-Improvement', u'urlkey': u'self-improvement', u'id': 3336}, {u'name': u'Personal Development', u'urlkey': u'personal-development', u'id': 16468}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Dating and Relationships', u'urlkey': u'dating-and-relationships', u'id': 20246}, {u'name': u'Communication Skills', u'urlkey': u'communication-skills', u'id': 20923}, {u'name': u'Successful Relationships', u'urlkey': u'successful-relationships', u'id': 22480}, {u'name': u'Find your Soulmate', u'urlkey': u'find-your-soulmate', u'id': 23350}, {u'name': u'Self Exploration', u'urlkey': u'self-exploration', u'id': 29158}, {u'name': u'Self-Empowerment', u'urlkey': u'self-empowerment', u'id': 38757}, {u'name': u'Relationship Building', u'urlkey': u'relationship-building', u'id': 49581}, {u'name': u'Confidence and Self-Esteem', u'urlkey': u'confidence-and-self-esteem', u'id': 63753}, {u'name': u'Spiritual Singles', u'urlkey': u'spiritual-singles', u'id': 88655}, {u'name': u'Manifest Your Soulmate', u'urlkey': u'manifest-your-soulmate', u'id': 128089}]"
Davis Women seeking new women friends,"<p>I started this in 2015 because my last two friends living in California and Davis&nbsp;moved out of town, and I found myself&nbsp;looking for friends not just to do things with, but also to sometimes have serious conversations about topics of import to our country, our world, our families and to our inner selves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This group is not about specific activities, but about activities as a way to interact with other women.&nbsp; Sometimes this leads to personal friendships outside the group, and sometimes it's just about a get-together with other women.&nbsp; But EVERY meeting so far has been a GREAT TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have lots of brainiacs, but we have plenty of regular people to keep us balanced.&nbsp; There is a strong contingent of younger women, a good number of women with children in school and number of us are empty nesters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This should go without saying, but intolerance and back-biting is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp; If you don't like someone, keep it to yourself.&nbsp; If you don't like an entire group of people, such as Jews or African Americans, then this isn't the right place for you.&nbsp; You don't have to be a Liberal, but you do have to be willing to take each woman as an individual, and not judge her based on her race, religion, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is group is strictly for women who live in Davis, or who work a regular Davis job with a Davis address.&nbsp; (If you live elsewhere, why not start a group yourself?&nbsp; It's easy!)</p>
<p>All new members are asked to come to a get together within their first three months, plan a get together within their first three months, or contribute toward the cost of maintaining the group, which I personally pay for out of my (very lean) pocket.</p>
<p>We all look forward to meeting you soon!</p>

FEMININE PROSPERITY Meetup Group,"<p>Hello Ladies,</p>
<p>I created this group because I have found that women thrive when they are an integral part of a loving, supportive, emotionally healthy community.</p>
<p>We've heard many spiritual teachers, and now scientists as well, telling us that we really do create our own reality. But we have been programmed from our earliest years with lies about who we are and what we are capable of doing and being. In order to reverse that programming from our parents, our schools, our media and our entire society, we need a lot of support. We need a community consisting of loving people who take 100% responsibility for their lives and challenge you to do the same. We need a clear system to follow which teaches us how to dance with the Law of Attraction in a way that really works. Through exciting, transformational events, supportive meetings and fun activities, we are committed to keeping our vibration HIGH as much of the time as possible. Feeling wonderful, laughing, loving, creating ordinary miracles attracts more of the same! Come join us on our wild joyride!</p>

Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles,"<p>Opening the LOTUS ~ Women's Sexual Empowerment Circles are for women who want a safe, shame-free space to discuss sexuality. &nbsp;We share our stories, gain strength from each other, learn about our bodies, discuss orgasm, sexual preferences, sexual styles, body image, sexual shame &amp; trauma, and heal any wounds we may have around our sexual experiences. &nbsp;We will gain insight from HomePlay exercises specifically designed to empower us as women on this transformational journey.</p>
<p>LOTUS blooms as:</p>
<p>Loving Ourselves Fully</p>
<p>Opening to Orgasm</p>
<p>Trusting Our Authentic Expressions</p>
<p>Union with Self, Beloved &amp; Divine</p>
<p>Surrendering to Satisfaction</p>
<p>In Opening the LOTUS circles we explore each one of these themes through story telling, group activities, diad work, online instruction and sex education.</p>
<p>The Lotus Flower has long been used in eastern spirituality to symbolize female sexuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Taken from</span><a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com""> mythencyclopedia.com</a></p>
<p><i>""In Asian mythology the lotus often symbolizes the female sexual organs, from which new life is born. Lotuses appear in both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Hindus refer to the god Brahma as ""lotus-born "" for he is said to have emerged from a lotus that was the navel, or center, of the universe. The lotus is also the symbol of the goddess Padma, who appears on both Hindu and Buddhist monuments as a creative force.</i></p>
<p><i>The holiness of the flower is illustrated by the legend that when the Buddha walked on the earth he left lotuses in his trail instead of footprints. One myth about the origin of Buddha relates that he first appeared floating on a lotus. According to a Japanese legend, the mother of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Nichiren.html"">Nichiren</a>&nbsp;(Lotus of the Sun) became pregnant by dreaming of sunshine on a lotus. Nichirin founded a branch of Buddhism in the 1200s. The phrase ""Om mani padme hum,"" which both Hindus and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/knowledge/Buddhism.html"">Buddhists</a>&nbsp;use in meditation, means ""the jewel in the lotus"" and can refer to the Buddha or to the mystical union of male and female energies"".</i></p>
<p>Opening the LOTUS as Love, Orgasm, Trust, Union &amp; Surrender encourages us as women to step into our full, authentic, freely expressed sexual selves.</p>

Mona Lisa's Smile,"Do you actually enjoy sex or want to? Are you ready to own your sexuality? Reclaim it, heal it and celebrate it? Women need a safe space in which to heal, explore, examine and learn about their sexuality. This is a group for women to talk openly and freely about women's sexuality, sexual exploration, shaking up the social norms, and ignoring social taboos. So much of our popular culture is built on the idea that sex is for men. That men are the pursuers of sex, and women are the prize to be had. That women only ""give up"" sex to men in exchange for love and commitment, and that women who give it up too easily are, at best, fools who don't know how to broker good deals for ourselves. The idea of women as the sexual gatekeepers, the natural wielders of ""no,"" is so strongly embedded in our culture that women who enthusiastically say ""yes!"" because we actually like sex are profoundly threatening.","[{u'name': u""Women's Social"", u'urlkey': u'women', u'id': 10232}, {u'name': u'Human Sexuality', u'urlkey': u'human-sexuality', u'id': 17854}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Open Relationships', u'urlkey': u'open-relationships', u'id': 19785}, {u'name': u'Dating and Relationships', u'urlkey': u'dating-and-relationships', u'id': 20246}, {u'name': u'Women and Sexuality', u'urlkey': u'women-and-sexuality', u'id': 20499}, {u'name': u'Sexual Education', u'urlkey': u'sexual-education', u'id': 20591}, {u'name': u'Sensual and Erotic Education', u'urlkey': u'sensual-and-erotic-education', u'id': 20593}, {u'name': u'Bisexual Women', u'urlkey': u'bisexual-women', u'id': 21737}, {u'name': u'Alternative Lifestyles', u'urlkey': u'alternative-lifestyles', u'id': 24818}, {u'name': u""Women's Sexuality"", u'urlkey': u'womens-sexuality', u'id': 26430}, {u'name': u'Sexuality Awareness', u'urlkey': u'sexuality-awareness', u'id': 32303}, {u'name': u'Swingers', u'urlkey': u'swinger', u'id': 61474}, {u'name': u'Sensuality', u'urlkey': u'celebrate-sensuality', u'id': 93385}, {u'name': u'Sex and Sexuality', u'urlkey': u'sex-and-sexuality', u'id': 129425}]"

<p>In our culture, we are conditioned and programmed from birth with the script of the dominators of our culture. In this community we bond, grow, learn, unlearn, celebrate life. As a result of our conditioning from our society and our biological families, we act in ways and create a life that is counter to our own and our collective benefit. Through presentations, instruction, practices, video, creative expression, group exercises, healing practices, love, play, and emotion in safe created space, we will allow our spirit, our soul, our minds and our physical body to return to our essential state (to our essence) in connection to all (rather than in isolation).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we speak of personal growth we are creating a life that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - More and more Conscious<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Living a life toward Meaning<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - being Considerate of the effects our thoughts, emotions, choices and actions have on ourselves, others, the world<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Acknowledging the connection between ourselves and everything everyone and everything that appears not us<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are a group of women committed to taking an intentional journey of growth together, waking up, bonding, learning to love, making deep connection, real community, calling on one another, celebrating together and becoming a community.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Community Home is ""Demeter's Magical Sanctuary"": Healing rooms, educational center, nature retreat, holistic and spiritual lifestyle learning, community.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This community is for all those who self define as women.

We look to build someone up not tear them down. We will discuss shadow (or unhealthy patterns), but in a loving supportive manner, and we will practice healthy patterns. Personal antagonistic attack will not be tolerated. Each one teach one. Humility allows growth, defensiveness prevents it. Change is life and life is change.

Goddess Painting Class,"Paint your OWN sacred icon of the Divine Feminine, *even if you've NEVER painted before!* This class is a supportive, welcoming environment for artists and NON-artists alike to paint the Goddess in her many forms. Led by Katie Ketchum and Jennifer Mantle and based on Shiloh Sophia's Color of Woman method, we gather once a month to feed your spirit and guide you through creating a personal icon from beginning to end. The Color of Woman method was developed by Shiloh to enable you to create a painting you love without any prior knowledge or skill. Jennifer and Katie both thought they could never paint- and now not only teach but have had solo shows of their own work and routinely sell paintings! Classes take place in sacred space and begin with an opening and connecting to the Goddess we are working with that month, and then step-by-step instruction with live demo. This is a criticism-free zone. We are all about empowering and supporting each participant. Open to all, including men, GNC folks, kids, everyone. We also maintain an optional, private Facebook group that you're welcome to join upon taking a class. We would love to see you! Everything included in the class fee of $35, though if you wish to use a larger canvas than those we provide (which are typically around 9"" x 11"") and any favorite paints/brushes, feel free to do so. Kindly avoid the use of scented products.","[{u'name': u'Art', u'urlkey': u'art', u'id': 1502}, {u'name': u'Crafts', u'urlkey': u'craftswap', u'id': 10099}, {u'name': u'Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'spirituality', u'id': 10290}, {u'name': u'DIY (Do It Yourself)', u'urlkey': u'diy', u'id': 10438}, {u'name': u'Handmade Crafts', u'urlkey': u'handmade-crafts', u'id': 16459}, {u'name': u""Women's Empowerment"", u'urlkey': u'womens-empowerment', u'id': 17933}, {u'name': u'Goddesses', u'urlkey': u'goddesses', u'id': 20610}, {u'name': u'Creativity', u'urlkey': u'creative', u'id': 36229}, {u'name': u'Divine Feminine Wisdom', u'urlkey': u'divine-feminine-wisdom', u'id': 40243}, {u'name': u'Makers', u'urlkey': u'makers', u'id': 43887}, {u'name': u'Sacred Feminine', u'urlkey': u'sacred-feminine', u'id': 62062}, {u'name': u'Divine Feminine', u'urlkey': u'divine-feminine', u'id': 84775}, {u'name': u'Goddess Studies', u'urlkey': u'goddess-studies', u'id': 89391}, {u'name': u'Goddess Spirituality', u'urlkey': u'goddess-spirituality', u'id': 97136}, {u'name': u'Goddess Worship', u'urlkey': u'goddess-worship', u'id': 164227}]"

Dream Priestess(TM) Circle - Bay Area Women,"<p><span>The Dream Priestess(TM) Circle is a women's gathering where you can explore everyday magic. You will awaken and deepen your spiritual gifts (e.g. intuition), step into your spiritual power as a leader, and play with new ways of accessing spiritual guidance.</span> <br></p>
<p>Whether you're experienced with your spiritual gifts, or just discovering you have them, join us for creative exploration and fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gatherings are at my home and there's room for about 10 women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>About Amy Brucker</b></p>
<p>Amy is a Dream Priestess(TM) with an extensive background in shamanic healing and guidance, energy reading, dreamwork, creative expression, and business coaching. In her work, Amy uses her gifts as an intuitive empath to support strong, successful women who long to integrate their spiritual gifts into the full scope of their daily lives. She offers private mentoring programs as well as the Dream Priestess(TM) Initiation Program. She has a B.A. in art and an M.A. in spirituality, and was ordained as an interfaith minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dream Priestess(TM) engages her spiritual power to dream her life into being. She knows that the more connected she is to her intuition, imagination, dreams, and nature, the more easily she can create magic for the benefit of herself and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Personal Note:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>In the 15 years I've been teaching and mentoring, I've met many women who are intuitives, empaths, psychics, mediums, etc., but who keep this part of themselves secret so they can succeed in their careers or retain respect from their family and friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These women often feel like they're leaving half of themselves locked in the closet, and consequently, they feel unfulfilled and alone despite their success. Yet more and more women are tired of hiding out. They're ready to confront their fears and be more open about who they are, and that's where I can help. When my clients work wit me, they begin to trust their gifts in bigger ways. They use their gifts to navigate their lives, relationships, health, businesses or careers. They feel more and more confident in who they are, and as a result, they begin to feel the deep soulful satisfaction that comes from living their true purpose.</span> <br></p>

East Bay Feminist Book Club,"<p><span>The </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1557049517861114/"">East Bay Feminist Book Club</a><span> is a social group open to all people who want to expand their knowledge about feminism and women's rights issues. We will read from a variety of feminist camps and persectives, including 2nd wave, 3rd wave, Black feminism, lesbian feminism, trans* perspectives, riot grrrl movement, third world feminism, etc. We'll also read things that aren't directly about feminism, but are interesting to read and discuss from a feminist lens.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p>Our meetings are a space for open and respectful discussions of different viewpoints. Sometimes discussions stay strictly on the texts; other times, readings lend themselves to more personal discussions. Please check out our <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Feminist-Book-Club/pages/Discussion_Guidelines_-_work_in_progress"">Discussion-Guideline-in-progress</a> before attending meetings, and feel free offer suggestions and critiques.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On readings: we tend to alternate between shorter readings (articles, short stories, essays, etc.) and longer pieces (books, plays, graphic novels, etc.). Care is taken to select readings that represent a broad range of genres, subjects, schools of thought, written by folks of varying backgrounds. We have a list of possible books, articles, etc., to read--please add to it&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Feminist-Book-Club/pages/Book_List_-_please_add_your_own%21"">here</a>&nbsp;or PM your friendly neighborhood moderator with suggestions!</p>
<p><span>RSVP's for individual book meetup events will be closed at 25 to make sure they stay small enough that everyone who wishes to has a chance to speak. We have strictly social meetups (no reading, just chatting and often booze) about once a month, and occasionally we meetup for other relevant events (talks, movies, etc.). Ideas for movies/plays/happy hour spots/ etc. are welcome! Members are also encouraged to host events that interest them. Ping me for details!&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p>Dues are $5/year and can be paid through meetup, or directly to your friendly neighborhood mod (Hope) in person or through Venmo (@HopeRosalind). Dues go to paying meetup.com the fees to run the group.&nbsp;</p>
