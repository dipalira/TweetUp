      "<p>Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher. Drinking Liberally gives like-minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where you can freely talk politics.</p>\n",
      "<p>While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't&nbsp;do it.</p>\n",

      "<p><b>This Meetup should appeal to and draw articulate, creative, politically savvy and highly talented communicators with an irreverent sense of humor and terrific writing skills --- especially screen or stage writers, investigative journalists, short story writers, and film script developers. The Meetup will be a conspiracy to expose and share by satire, parody or otherwise, disgusting and unreported pathetic truths about the Trump Gang in a humorous or comical fashion. Much information is not being shared or highlighted by the mainstream media or blogosphere. <br> <br>• Think of this Meetup as intellectual jiu jitsu with a purpose ... to hasten the end of Trump's administration. Trump and his gang provide plenty of daily outrages to share with those not tuning in to the despotic&nbsp; regime.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>• Protests and marching are great; meanwhile, much of the public is oblivious to many truths. <br> <br>• Truths are not self-evident. The mission is to educate with humor. \"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.\" --- George Bernard Shaw. <br> <br>Hope to meet in Evanston bi-weekly initially to meet new members and discuss opportunities. Thereafter, we will brainstorm ideas, determine methods, and implement projects.&nbsp;</b> <br></p>\n",

      "<p>Guns Save Life is a regional civil rights organization that works to educate the public about the benefits of firearm ownership. The group had its origins as a county grassroots committee of the Illinois State Rifle Association in about 1995, initially meeting in Rantoul, and later holding its monthly meetings in the Jolly Roger restaurant in Urbana, IL. GSL was later incorporated as its own non-profit corporation and today represent gun owners in Illinois, Indiana and beyond in proactive grassroots activism promoting and defending firearm rights and the civil right of self-defense. Guns Save Life’s Mission statement: To promote and educate the youth of America in the use of firearms and gun safety. To educate the population regarding the safe use of firearms and the history of firearms as they shaped our country from the pioneers through various wars to the present. To promote and encourage shooting sports available to all who wish to enjoy their benefits by offering hunter safety and marksmanship programs. To encourage the building of public shooting facilities to further educate the general population and those in politics who lack the knowledge of safe use of firearms and their importance to the well-being of the general public.</p>\n",
