Just look at movies and TV shows from 50, 30, even 10 years ago; how many of them predicted today's world accurately? And why did they fail?

Reproductive Eco Wellness,0,"This is great space for people looking to get healthy, considering or in the midst of procreation, trying to integrate more sustainability into their life, or just plain curious about any of the above. We're looking at the BIG frame of human reproduction - how we (re)create our bodies, our fuller selves, communities, cultures, and new life, within a spiritual and ecological context. We are getting inspired to apply and practice intentional reproduction of all kinds in our own lives. The human body and its energy are miraculous, multilayered systems, and to enter the process of reproduction with this consciousnesss - whether that is healing at a cellular level, evolving our physical lifestyle, healing our lineage, or preparing for pregnancy and parenting - means taking a holistic, systemic approach to wellness. What we eat, what we consume, what we think and feel towards our own bodies, and how we navigate existing choices along the spectrum of reproduction - all of this plays into the ecology of reproductive wellness. It takes a village - and a planet - to BE fully human! This is a space to learn and share about different tools and processes that can inform an integrated, Earth-conscious, joyful life with reverence for the human body, mind, heart and spirit and wider circle of life. Focus will be on honoring our unique paths to nutritional agency, consumer impact/footprint, reproductive choice and education in birth and beyond, healing our families and communities through individual responsibility, holistic approaches to modern health obstacles, and connecting to #JuicyEarth. All folks of all reproductive capacities, interests and experiences welcome. "

SF & Bay Area Zeitgeist movement social consciousness group,0,"At this point the purpose of this group is to gain and grow members of fellow people who see the world for what it really is and the true root cause for all of the perilous issues we face. I saw Zeitgeist Moving Forward a year ago and in that finally found something that illustrated so masterfually everything I had always thought, the documentary was mind blowing and life changing. Thank you Netflix for adding this to your library for the public to see!
 There seems to be no real forums to actually talk to other like minded people even online, which is frustrating. Most of us know the masses are not open minded enough to even realize why they have the beliefs they have. so really I  can count on my hand the number of people I know who have agree with a resource based economy, I find it harder and harder to relate to the indoctrinated masses.
So it would be really nice to see if we can get some people to join, and who are up for chatting.   And hopefully get to a point to where we can have some regular in person meetups.... And maybe attend next year's Z-Day. 
Would love for you to join, and open to any and all suggestions.

The San Mateo Organic Beef Group,0,"Simply put, we love beef and support the overall health of our  environment, but had yet to see a group that combined both areas into  one group.  Since the creator of the group lives in the Peninsula, she  decided to create The San Mateo Organic Beef Meetup Group for those of  us who want to continue being beef enthusiasts in a way that is more  supportive of the environment. Do you thoroughly enjoy the  consumption of beef and want to support the local sustainable  agriculture movement? Then this group might be for you! Please read on  and find out....Given our enjoyment of beef and desire to  support the sustainable agriculture movement, we are on a quest to  discover, learn about, and of course savor, these beef being produced  locally in more environmentally responsible environments. That means we  have the opportunity to meet our local farmers and ranchers who are  implementing these natural and organic processes to the extent they are  able. The 'artisan' part, for me, means these folks are producing  product in a traditional manner which can be done in smaller or larger  scale.....but always, with traditional methodologies which respect the  environment and the animals.We realize the process of creating a  purely natural or organic growing and/or processing environment is  costly, a long process and challenging on many levels. There are many  ranchers and farmers who are doing what they can to gradually convert to  an environmentally sustainable model. This group is about inclusion and  tolerance, so we strive to learn about and support those farmers' and  ranchers' efforts and products as they continue to make the effort to  this.If you like what you read, please join us and tell everyone you believe might enjoy learning we exist, as well!Join us on this journey!"

North Bay Intentional Communities:Ecovillages and more,0,"""The next Buddha will not take the form of an individual. The next Buddha may take the form of a community; a community practising understanding and loving kindness, a community practicing mindful living. This may be the most important thing we can do for the survival of the earth."" - Thich Nhat Hanh
Meet other local people who live in, or are interested in creating, intentional communities, including collectives, co-housing and cooperatives. Interested in both urban and rural initiatives for becoming more self-sufficient in key areas of economics, energy, food, housing, transportation, education, organization and governance. Think community incubator!
An emphasis on creating healthy, high-functioning, supportive community that is in harmony with the earth's natural systems is foundational.
More than a discussion group, it is hoped that concrete action plans to address the very real barriers for creating a sustainable civilization will emanate from this group.
For example, access to land. The majority of our food supply is not local and is dependent upon fossil fuels. We must bring it local and wean ourselves from petroleum. Yet land is expensive and unaffordable to beginning farmers. Is there a solution?
Access to housing. It too is unaffordable to buy for an increasing majority of people, or even build given current zoning and building requirements. Is there a solution?
Access to employment and a living wage. Many people lost their jobs thanks to the wall street meltdown and cannot find a new job. One answer is to start a business. Most businesses require capitalization. Bank loans are tougher then ever to obtain. Is there a solution?
Access to tools and technology. Do we really all have to own one of everything we need? If we cannot afford it must we simply do without? Besides that, the earth has finite resources and a burgeoning population. Is there a solution?
There are solutions to all these barriers and more. Exciting innovative solutions are being devised, tried and tested the world over. Why not here too? If that wheel has already been invented, we'll find it and adapt if for use here. If not, we will invent our own.
Last, but not least, if you are not familiar with the intentional communities movement, please familiarize yourself by visiting our web pages where we are placing links to additional information for your edification. Simply click on the Pages menu item above.
The village can and will return. Come, join us."
Healthy Minds And Bodies,0,"If you would like to feel better, have more energy, lose weight (and keep it off), strengthen your immune system, and think from a higher place, yet you have trouble creating the habits that will facilitate this, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE!
People already know what's healthy and what's not healthy for their brains and their bodies.  More information about how important exercise is or how bad processed sugars are will not benefit anyone.  
What people don't know is how to prioritize which modifications will serve the individual best.  Everyone's lifestyle is at least a little different, meaning the most beneficial changes are going to vary person to person.  This Meetup will bring clarity as to what are the most important new habits for you to create.  This is the easy part...
The biggest challenge for most people is not figuring out what change to make nor it actually making the change, it's sustaining the change.  This group provides the tools, strategies, and support system to help you adopt these changes for the long run.  This is what will allow your health to truly flourish.
The Meetups are hosted by Dr. Steven Cain DC, and Carol Zizich.  Dr. Steve has been passionate about helping people adopt healthier lifestyles since he was a teenager.  He has a focus in health coaching and brain health.  Carol Zizich transformed her health and her life 20 years ago and loves to help others do the same.  She is a Reiki Master and has been certified in lifestyle coaching.
The Meetups are designed to be fun, engaging, and enlightening.  In each session we will...
- Learn new elements of what a healthy lifestyle is + how to apply it (sometimes we will have guest speakers)
- Engage with the topics (we will incorporate exercise when we discuss exercise, we will host potluck lunches when we discuss nutrition, we will partake in meditative techniques when we discuss stress management)
- Discuss how we are progressing towards our goals.  The Meetup hosts will guide group discussions that create a supportive team environment and bring clarity to the next step to take.  The hosts will also log each participants progress (ie how many hours a week they have been exercising or how many servings of vegetables they are having a day) so that each participant can see their charted progress over time.
This Meetup is designed open to anyone who would like to upgrade their health."

Walking in San Francisco for Health and History,0,"See legal disclaimer at bottom of text. EVERYONE MAY NOW JOIN THE GROUP EXCEPT THOSE FEW WHO WERE BANNED. Walking or hiking. Meet other local people who are interested in walking or hiking for fitness and learning about San Francisco's history, including its movie history. This walking group is unique. It is primarily a health group with a dash of history talk for flavor. It is for people in average physical shape who need restroom stops and not for athletes or people with serious medical conditions.
We keep our group together. We go on many different urban walks, in the best areas, that vary greatly in amounts of climbing and history facts. We walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes at a walk's end we have an optional dinner together at a fine restaurant, usually Indian, reasonably priced.
Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley & Alameda.
We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. 99 out of every 100 doctors say ""JOIN THIS GROUP!""
NEWS:  We have a walk scheduled for Saturday, March 17th. 
Our ""group photo"" was taken July 5th, 2015 at our walk ""The March to the Sea.""

Jeet Kune Do/Kali Fierce Egalitarians,0,"""What would happen if a year-old baby fell from a fourth-floor window onto the head of a burly truck driver, standing on the sidewalk?

You may feel as helpless as a year-old infant-as far as fighting is concerned; but please remember: (1) YOU WEIGH MORE THAN A BABY, and (2) YOU NEED NOT FALL FROM A WINDOW TO PUT YOUR BODY-WEIGHT INTO MOTION.

Welcome! We are a group of people who learn and practice the Yoga of Breath as a means to total wellness of a healthy body and a stress-free mind. Beginners, intermediate practitioners, seasoned yogis ... all are part of this group.
The first act we do in our life is to breathe in. And the last act of our life is to breathe out. Between this first breath in and the last breath out are all the breaths that we call life. The breath is our best friend -- it's always with us. And yet, we hardly know much about it. What's more ... it holds some timeless secrets to our health, peace of mind, and well-being.

With just a little practice it's easy to use your breath to instantly

infuse your body with energy
detoxify through the breath
make your mind calm
control negative emotions
increase focus and concentration
create a sense of well-being

We're here to unite groups of patients who share common goals."

Northern California Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group,0,"Hello! Welcome to the Northern California Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group. You are also more than welcome to visit our Southern California Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group for Southern California support. Here you will meet other people interested in alternative health and naturopathic healing via therapeutic grade essential oils. This is also a wonderful website for additional educational support. Please feel free to check out the ""More"" drop down menu, then click on ""Files."" An excellent resource is the file entitled ""Supporting Websites.""
Such oils are the industry leaders in essential oils. In fact, they are the industry standard oils with massage therapists and in many alternative healing practices. They are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, an emerging therapy. See below for more information. They are also used in hospitals throughout the U.S. They are even used intravenously in the Nova Vita clinic in Ecuador. They are very different than food-grade and perfume-grade essential oils (EOs) sold in many health food stores. Most health food store essential oils and other ""knock off"" companies are either synthetic, a few molecules are changed, cut with alcohol and other ingredients or are distilled quickly at high temperatures for fast, mass production, hence making the oils more affordably appealing, yet with no healing properties. Young Living Essential Oils are true therapeutic-grade EOs. In fact, Gary Young coined the term therapeutic-grade for essential oils. They are the purest grade EOs on the market. They are the essence, the blood, the life force, the immune system of the tree, plant, shrub, bush, flower, fruit, seed, etc.
Per Royal Raymond Rife's research back in the 1920's, just as our bodies have an electrical frequency, so do therapeutic-grade EOs. Processed/canned foods have a frequency of 0 MHz. Fresh produce has a frequency of 0-15MHz. Dried herbs have a frequency of 12-22 MHz. Fresh herbs have a frequency of 20-27 MHz. Did you know that therapeutic grade essential oils have the highest level of frequencies of all other substances in the world: 52-320 MHz! Just as you can take most herbs internally (e.g. via capsule, as a supplement, etc.), so can you with therapeutic-grade EOs! Another way to look at it in the herbal sense is they are the most concentrated form of the herb. In fact, they are 100-10,000 times stronger than the herbs they came from!
Such EOs are being used in hospitals, alternative medicine offices such as naturopathic doctors (N.D.s), doctor of osteopathy (D.O.s) and chiropractors as well as health & wellness centers, spas, massage therapy, psycho-therapists, hypnotists and raindrop therapist's offices. Yoga and meditation can also be incredibly enhanced through the use of these healing oils.
Many households are learning how to replace many of their ""over-the-counters"" as well as prescription medications with therapeutic grade EOs. Children are learning to come to mommy or daddy for their lavender or peppermint oil when they need to be wound down or have a tummy ache! In fact, many pet lovers as well as veterinarian offices are working with the oils as well, with incredible success! Note: you only want to use true therapeutic-grade essential oils on your pets for safety pursposes.
Did you know that such oils are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, a revolutionary way to bring balance and harmony to the body...physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is an emerging therapy in many massage therapist's offices, spas, alternative medicine clinics, etc. Raindrop Technique was created more than a decade ago. The molecules of therapeutic-grade EOs are so small they are the only substance on the planet which may actually cross the blood-brain barrier. You do not have to be a certified Raindrop Therapist to learn the technique or to give it to family and friends. You can also learn Raindrop to help boost your family and friend's immunity, such as during our cold winter months, by giving them Raindrop Technique.
An additional note, oils for healing, cleansing and masach (hebrew word for anoint, which means to smear, spread or massage) are mentioned more than 250 times in the bible. There is an answer for everything through nature. Essential oils have been used for healing/medicinal purposes since the beginning of time.
Thank you for spending the time to get to know a little bit about Therapeutic-Grade Essential Oils and their incredible benefits!
We are looking forward to ""Meetup"" with all of you!
Wellness, Purpose, Abundance & Vitality,  Laura Karowsky, Tina Jones and our entire Young Living Company of Angels family!

Making mistakes and not dancing perfectly on the beat is okay.   Being a beginner is okay.  We are not snobs.  We want to make going to dance clubs an enjoyable, friendly, social, and personal experience -- not a dance off or a showcase for one's greatness or an exercise in competitive social gamesmanship.
Our purpose is socialize, make friends, improve our dance skills,  create a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere, build community, and have fun!
We only have 4 requirements.
1. You MUST RSVP whether you will attend the event or not.
2. ""Flakers"" and No-Shows will be banned.
3. Follow and read the event details. Simple
4. You will make an attempt to attend within 3-4 events or you will be removed from the group. "

Adapt Foundation,0,"The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.
We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.
There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.
The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you. You are certainly welcome to join us!"

Sonoma County Wanderers,0,"Welcome to The Wanderers!  You have just discovered Sonoma County's most active hiking group!  We love to hike...during the week, the afternoon, the weekend and even by the light of the full moon!  If you love to hike, you have just found your new home!  
We are about the journey as well as the destination.  We are striving to meet the hikers that fall into the middle zone...people that.enjoy moderate mileage with moderate altitude gain with a challenge thrown in occasionally at a moderate pace!    We are a group that wants to explore and constantly include new hikes while doing our favorites on a regular basis.    A group that is out there during the week as well as the weekend.
Our outings will normally be in the 5-12 mile range.  We are looking for people that are looking to improve their fitness level or are maintaining their current level.  If you are a moderate hiker that is hiking frequently you will find our hikes quite enjoyable.  If you are a new hiker or have recently just got back to hiking then our pace might be challenging for you at first until you fully get back into wandering on the trails.  We do average a speed of 2.5-3.0 mph and we keep going.  We wait at trail junctions and those of you in the front will have to wait and those of you in the rear will find that the group starts off when you are safely within sight.  Oh and YES, there will be altitude gain included in almost every hike.  You will need to be comfortable and happy with walking uphill.  You also will need to be steady on your feet for the down hills.  Once again, we stop briefly to keep the group together from time to time but we do keep going with the exception of our lunch/snack break.   A word of caution-if you haven't been hiking regularly you will need to give yourself some time and consistent participation to be comfortable with the group's pace.  Most people that start with us think our pace of 2.5-3.0 is fast until they have completed 4-5 hikes.   Don't get discouraged after one hike.  A common comment I get from new hikers is that they didn't have time to enjoy the scenery.  Trust me....as you continue with the group, you will find yourself being very comfortable with the pace and will fully enjoy the scenery.   
We are about hiking.  If you are into plant, mushroom, scat or bad mood studies then this group is not for you.  Although we love pictures and encourage photographs, if you are having a hard time staying with the group, you will need to let others take the photos until you find yourself able to keep up.
I'm not a professional hiker or guide and I don't have specialized training in first aid so I need to hold everyone completely responsible for their own safety and well-being. But, what I do have is a love of the outdoors and a desire to be there..whenever possible. I also have knowledge of many local hikes and am ALWAYS exploring new ones!  Come join me and we will simply enjoy this gorgeous area that we live in, find new adventures, laugh, talk and probably learn something new every hike while making new friends.
Happy Trails!"

Extraordinary Living Santa Cruz,0,"Extraordinary Living Santa Cruz is about connecting with our
inner wisdom even in our ordinary days. When we do the ordinary
becomes extraordinary. This group is for people who would like
energy and vitality to be their new ordinary day. It is for people
who would like to find themselves smiling and experiencing joy even
as they stand in line at the grocery store. When we are connected
with our own inner wisdom the ordinary becomes extraordinary
everyday. Things just seem to fall into place. We seem to know just
what we need to say and do. This meet up is for people who want to
develop this state of synchronicity as their typical average day.
Each and everyone of us already has all the personal wisdom and
resources we need to live the extraordinary life we want. With all
the the business of ordinary living those resources get pushed
aside and forgotten. When it comes right down to it the only thing
between us and the extraordinary life we could be leading is our
choices. We make choices all day everyday. Every choice, both big
and small is moving us toward or away from the extraordinary life
we want. Our present situation is the result of earlier choices.
This group is for people who -who know the choices of today create
their tomorrow -who want to create the habit of choosing
consciously -who are ready to get into action to raise the bar in
their lives"

Tom & I remember the challenges we had in learning to dance tango, a dance like none other, and we bring a special approach to teaching tango---I like to call it ""beginner's mind"" (in the mind of beginners there are many possibilities, in the minds of experts, few.)
Come join us all every Wednesday at 7:30 at La Pista, 766 Brannan St (between 6th & 7th), SF. And coming in February, 2012, we will offer Beginner's Mind Tango, every Friday night 7 to 8pm.
Join the ranks of those tango lovers (OK, addicts might fit) who plan our travel, work, and much of our lives around the next milonga (the venue where tango is danced). Many, but not all have been to Mecca (Buenos Aires). Come to a beginner lesson and get infected with this infectious ""at-ease.""

As of now, I plan on scheduling walks approximately once a week (early enough in the day to end before dark). This schedule could expand to additional days or short weekend hikes (probably on Sunday afternoons) if there is enough interest and participation.
Anyone who meets the above criteria is welcome to join. If you're interested, but can't make the weekly commitment, join anyway as our schedule is somewhat fluid and could expand to include different dates/times.
Only ""YES"" RSVPs are required! However, if you say you're coming please show up. Otherwise, please change your RSVP to ""NO"" so you don't get a ""No Show"" on your record. Out of respect for fellow walkers, people with three (3) no shows will be removed from the group.
Please see our other Pages (under the Pages Tab) for Rules and Agreements regarding participation in the South Bay Walking Group.

Tai Chi with Cheery Living,0,"Tai Chi is a ""meditation through movements"". Currently Huiling is teaching Tai Chi 18-form. Huiling has practiced Tai Chi 18-form over 20 years. Tai Chi 18-form can be practiced by anyone, anywhere, anytime, in any length (5-10 minutes, or longer). It's especially great for people who tend to sit for a long time at a desk. As a financial analyst worked in the banking industry over 14 years with long time sitting, Huiling really benefited from and truly believe in this natural, simple and rejuvenating exercise. The benefits from Tai Chi are: 1. Reduce capo tunnel symptom, alleviate neck and back sore from long sitting in front of a computer. 2. Enhance immune system, less allergic to pollen, less cold and flu, more stamina and energy 3. Increase flexibility. It's safe and no impact on joints. 4. Reduce stress, happier and more balanced view of life.  As an example, with Huiling's Tai Chi lesson help, Mary, one of Huiling's students was able to stop her many years of smoking. Huiling is offering lessons to individuals/corporate employees to learn this wonderful tool to improve their wellness and increase work productivity. Meeting Time and Location: Thus 11:10am-11:55am at St. Mary Square in San Francisco or by appointment For more Tai Chi 18-form background info, please visit  This is the same Tai Chi that Huiling is teaching. 1.

Santa Cruz Women Hiking,0,"Dear fellow hikers or potential hikers,
I love hiking in the fresh air of mountain and sea, and want to join with other women in exploring hiking trails in Santa Cruz and neighboring counties. My goal is to get good exercise, enjoy good company, and experience the serenity and inspiration of the great outdoors.
Most of the hikes I will organize will be in the 3- to 7- mile range with a gain of 200 to 2000 feet.  There are other organizers, however, who may do longer and/or more difficult hikes. If you're not ready to do the longer steeper hikes, try the easier ones! You are also welcome to come and do a portion of a hike, then return on your own. That's how I got started!
This group is for women of any age, who love hiking in beautiful natural spaces, or who would like to give it a try! It's also a relaxed and easy way to make new friends :)
If you have any questions about the group or the hikes, feel free to send me an email.
Best,
Kitty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I will do my best to describe the level of difficulty of each hike, so you can decide if the hike is right for you. I'll use the descriptions below to indicate how much uphill there is. In addition to the uphill, please take into consideration how long the hike is. A hike may be described as moderately easy, but if it's 6 or 7 miles long, that distance may be too much for you at this time.
Moderately easy = Up and down, but total elevation gain of less than 400 feet. 
Moderate = Total gain 400 to 800 feet. Lots of up and down. Can be steep stretches, but no really long steep uphill stretches. 
Moderately difficult = Total gain greater than 800 feet. May be some really steep sections and/or very long stretches of uphill. "

The practice of qigong includes various different postures, movements, breath and energy awareness, self-massage, and meditation. One could say, qigong in its highest expression, is for mind, energy, and form, to become more fully aligned and integrated with the wholeness of Spirit. 
Taijiquan is a form of martial qigong, which can be practiced solely for it's health and meditative benefits, and/or as an internal martial art. When practiced with consistency, these exercises help to relax and strengthen the body, the internal organs, and the immune system, improve balance and agility, build up the protective qi (energy) field, and bring quietude to the mind.  This ultimately helps promote longevity and an increased quality of living, as well as a clearer attunement of vital essence, energy, and Spirit (Jing, Qi, Shen). No taiji, qigong, or meditation experience is necessary, all are welcome attend.

Sheng Zhen Santa Cruz,0,"Sheng Zhen Gong is a series of natural movements and meditations that help unlock the full range of motion and grace inherent in the human body. This practice is a gift from heaven.  The words ""sheng zhen"" mean ""great purity"" and point to the original love that created qi and subsequently the rest of the universe.
More than just qigoing, when you practice Sheng Zhen you learn how to relax the body and go through each movement with the heart leading, enjoying the movements as one would enjoy being on vacation.  First you enter the ""qi state"" and feel your energy body leading the movements.  Gradually you move into the ""Sheng Zhen state,"" a feeling of being merged with Nature, merged with the universe, and the quiet wisdom of the heart takes over.  
As the heart opens through the practice of Sheng Zhen Gong, the experience of unconditional love becomes tangible and accessible. ""Gong"" literaly means ""practice"" or, more accurately, the results of that practice.  The results of the practice of Sheng Zhen include a healthier body, a happier heart, and an elevated spirit.
Classes are open to people of all ages and ability levels. 
I started this group to share the gift of Sheng Zhen with Santa Cruz.  I am happy that the group has been growing regularly and that many people have attended over the past several years.  We are adding new classes and workshops regularly and look forward to deepening this practice in Santa Cruz!"

Empowered Women Creating a Healthy Lifestyle,0,"Hello and welcome,
This is a supportive group for women interested in learning (and sharing) ways to create a loving and healthier lifestyle. My philosophy is that health is more than just what we put in our mouth. To stay 'healthy', we shall also consider our relationship with others, how we feel about ourselves, our career, of course nutrition and learning how to switch unhealthy habits into attainable and lasting practices.
Have you ever wanted to change something but got stuck or did it for a little bit then fell off the wagon? - raise your hand. Yup, quite a few of us, myself included. It is a constant effort to keep up with the changes, but here is the thing, the 'secret' to make them long lasting: is to make them fun and prioritizing yourself. Of course you might be asking, but I can't do it alone, sure you can! but to start we can find accountability in each other. (Trust me, I need some of that myself)
We might discuss topics (and not limited to) about health and wellness, healthy lifestyle, healthy eating, weight loss, women empowerment, acceptance, mindset, self-love, self-care, finding your 'why' and clarity, or do you need accountability? Depending how much interest there is, and to make it easier for people to participate, I might incorporate live-streaming (via FB, YouTube or zoom calls) which will be announced in advance.
My hope is that this group can provide the support and guidance in a loving environment with practical steps to create the life we want. It is a process and we are not alone.

"WALK IT OFF! Citrus Heights, Carmichael, Fair Oaks",0,"WELCOME! WE ARE THE Citrus Heights SPRINGIN' CHICKENS! AND WE'RE FAST WALKIN', TALKIN' & CLUCKING OFF THE POUNDS! 
Why join a gym for a treadmill when we have plenty of walking areas right here?  A classic eight-year study of 13,000 people conducted at the Institute for Aerobics Research under the direction of Dr. Steven Blair found that those who walked the equivalent of 30 minutes a day had a significantly lower risk of premature death than those who rarely exercised. So let's Walk It Off! 
Intro - Walk It Off is for women who want to start FAST walking regularly (3-5 Nights A Week) at a medium - fast pace (An 18-20 minute mile) for health and weight loss in Citrus Heights / Carmichael / Fair Oaks area. Meeting walk partners to help motivate each other and having regular & repeating meetups with safety in numbers is the main goal for this group. If you are a marathoner or run 10 miles per day please know that we are a beginning walking group with shorter fast walks. 
WHERE WE MEET - We will meet at a large nearby indoor Citrus Heights location in high temps or bad air days, or on rainy days, and outdoors at safe known neighborhoods or area parks.
WHEN - We meet in the PM HOURS, later afternoons AND many evenings indoors or earlier outside when the weather is more mild, depending on daylight hours. We walk approximately 2-3 miles which takes between 45 minutes to an hour. We can encourage each other, and there is safety in numbers! Mall walks have fast become a hit with this new group, as the mall has security, free parking, bathrooms, refreshments & shelter from the heat or rain all right there.. 
GOAL - The goal for this group is REGULAR FASTER PACED WALKING, shorter faster workouts more often, establishing a routine for cardio, health and fitness. If someone wants to host morning walks, they can do so, but this would mean a regular repeating commitment to HOST. Contact me if you are interested in this. 
SLOWER WALKERS - We welcome you, we have a few, and if you start coming out and doing this, you will see that your walk speed will generally increase. The evening Mall walks are perfect for everyone, we pass each other, and encourage and time our walks... HEY, no shopping! lol 
FUN STUFF - Occasional healthy dining out and Charity / Cause Walks will also be added to the calendar. If there's an event you'd like to add, just shoot me an email. 
Come on ladies, LET'S Walk It Off! =) "

Making Healthier Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts,0,"Do you have a passion for making ice cream, frozen custard, gelato, and/or sorbet? Perhaps you are interested in learning to make these frozen delectable treats for fun, family, coworkers, and friends. Are you already working ice cream magic at a professional or semi-professional level but have the desire to share recipes, mentor others, and/or provide a few tricks of the trade? 
Hi, I am Kevin and I love experimenting with and making healthier ice cream and frozen custard. Thanks to the encouragement of friends, coworkers, and family, I have recently started making them on a small, semi-pro level. It is easier than you may realize to make decent ice cream. In my Ben and Jerry's book on homemade ice cream and desserts, they mention how difficult it is to ""ruin"" a batch of ice cream. Chances are it will still be edible in the end! 
If you're on a budget, don't be discouraged. Let me emphasize that you don't need expensive, commercial equipment to make good ice cream and gelato. I've been successful using an old-fashioned ice cream maker (a model with a wooden bucket and electric motor), salt, and ice.
The ice cream varieties that I make are gluten-free, organic, non-GMO, and preservative-free. I plan to produce and test stylish alternative varieties including lactose-free and other lower glycemic varieties. So many folks want and need these alternatives. I take great pride in knowing that I am honoring my body and health while simultaneously honoring my sweet tooth! So little time and so much ice cream to make, 
You're cordially invited to share in the magic of learning, experimenting, creating, tasting, sharing, and celebrating ice cream and frozen desserts. Ever wondered what lavender blueberry vanilla custard would taste like? How about pistachio, mango, or grean tea ice cream?  Come join us for some ice cream alchemy, l welcome all skill levels. I look forward to meeting you! 
Sincerely, Kevin"

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,0,"This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! Visit Eat LIke A Goddess now for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body."

East Bay Healthy Sensitive's,0,"If the word ""conscientious"" had a photograph in the dictionary, the photograph would probably be of you. Your friends come to you when they want a listening ear, because they know you WILL actually listen. YOU, my friend, are also a noticer. You notice the subtle changes in expressions of people around you. You notice the change in colors of the sky as the sun sets. You notice the sound of birds chirping in the tree outside in your backyard. You are, in other words, a Highly Sensitive Person ( There is just one teensy weensy little problem. We don't live in a world that is solely made up of subtlety. We live in a world of loud noises, bright colors, constant contact, and fast-paced changes.
So while you are easily entertained, you are also easily over-stimulated. If this sounds like you, you might ALSO have found yourself feeling like you only really have two options in this life. You can either choose to ""fake it""...pretending that you don't mind all the noise in your open office floor plan or the loud sirens in the city you live in or the constant whistling from your cell phone. Making that choice may make you uncomfortable, anxious, sleepless, and perhaps even prone to getting sick, but at least it allows you to fully engage in the world and share your gifts. OR
You can choose to retreat away from the world. You can move out into the mountains, write poetry, and become the newest Walt Whitman. You might be disconnected, but at least you aren't getting depleted day after day. You are anxiety free, even if you're also lonely.
THIS group is for those who want to develop something in-between. You want to fully engage in the world, share your gifts, help others. You aren't afraid to get messy. You just want to do it WHILE ALSO keeping your sanity, your physical health, and your sense of aliveness.

Fun with Food - Cooking and sharing meals,0,"****   Please Note   ****  Fun with Food is on hiatus until February or March of 2017, although there will probably be a holiday meal in December.   Next year I'm hoping to do Korean food and seasoning, Knife Skills for new members and those who couldn't attend in the past, pasta making if people want to, sausage making, and even some desserts.  I still want to do the Crab Boil and the Sushi event is always popular.  ****
Cooking together is a great way to learn and share knowledge and to enjoy food and good company. When I first moved here a few years ago, I took an expensive cooking course, hoping to meet people. Didn't really work out the way I had hoped.  While I learned some things, it was less than I learned from cooking with others  in the firehouse and I've never seen anyone from those classes again.
The basic idea is that we cook together, learn together and share great meals with the new friends we have made while toiling over the pots and pans.  Even if you can barely boil water, you are welcome at any of the events!  Since this is not a class and the host is not an expert, the fees are low, basically covering the cost of ingredients. 
If you do have skills or knowledge, please pitch in to help your fellow cooks succeed!  That's what it's all about.  I'm hoping to learn from you, too.
Despite these caveats, the food always turns out delicious and the company is great!  
Please feel free to contact me at 415-683-0533 or fiatgirl@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments.

Bhakti Kitchen: Practicing  Kitchen Yoga  !,0,"Take your yoga off the mat and into the kitchen. Eating matters. Living matters. Love matters more.
Practicing kitchen yoga is about more than just the asana; it's about thriving, in the most wonderfully counter cultural kind of way! We've seen our own lives soften, bloom and grow through practicing kitchen yoga in its many forms, and we want to share that joy with you, too - so come, love and be nourished in this beloved melding of philosophy and practice.
We use Patanjali's Eight Limbs of Yoga as a model for taking our yoga off the mat and into the kitchen, whether it's through cooking, baking, mindful eating, or just breathing well, and in so doing, learning to nourish our whole selves, one another, and the world. We believe that what we eat matters, that eating can indeed be a sacred act, and that yoga's an ideal path to that union with the divine.
Inspired by progressives like Michael Pollan, Gabriel Cousens and John Robbins, we teach how to eat Real Food: whole, fresh, organic, local when possible, and plant-based, the kind of food that nourishes the whole being, the community, the body, the spirit and the mind, creating balance, or sattva, in the circle of life.
Our work is grounded in a bhakti spirit of love and devotion, an emphasis on ahimsa (less harming) and compassion, and great gratitude to our many teachers. By eating to awaken, food can truly become that which brings us from darkness into light. 
Namaste."

South Bay Hiking With Kids Meetup,0,"This is a group for parents with younger kids who want to explore the great outdoors (with their kids) in the South Bay and Santa Cruz. Kids enjoy hiking more when they have similar aged friends to hike with. We combine hiking with good ol' fashion nature exploration and play along the way. We typically meet once a month for a shortish hike (2-3 miles) that includes stops along the way for snacks and exploration.
Our hikes are often single track, windy trails and sometimes with obstacles along the way. This is partly intentional, as it helps keep kids engaged in the hike.  Wide, paved trails tend to be less interesting for kids.  So, most of our hikes are not stroller friendly. If you have a younger child who may not be able to hike long distances a child carrier is recommended.

BDD Support Group Meetup,0,"This is a support group for those living with BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder). This group is for those who are preoccupied and obsessed about a certain body part/s which interferes and paralyzes your life. Our goal is to restore our ""self"" into a fully accepted, truly happy and content person, and help you find recovery from the debilitating and destructive nature of BDD and other body image challenges. We understand that attending a BDD support group will be a challenge due to the nature of the disorder, but trust that showing up challenges the disorder and provides an opportunity to accept and change our way of thinking and to heal. We understand because we have BDD too, and we need this just as much as you because it is part of the healing process.
The gathering is all about being with others who can relate to you and understand what you're going through. The meeting will be a safe and supportive environment in which to share your feelings, frustrations or whatever is on your mind related to living with BDD (or other body image issues). Sharing our stories and experiences will be a big part of us getting together and healing together, and eventually we will use other resources to help us heal and move forward, with formats like the 12-step approach, CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) practices, DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy), as well as some spiritual practices for those who are open to that. 
The meetings are free, but we do accept any free will donations to help cover any related costs of the group. We (Lon and myself) have more than 3 years of experience facilitating BDD meetings in Santa Cruz and Pleasanton. We've learned how to offer a meeting/gathering that is supportive, welcoming and compassionate. If you are interested, you can contact me, Tim, or Lon.

Solano County Body Positive Meetup,0,"""In a society that profits from self-doubt, liking yourself is a rebellious act.""
Firstly, this meetup is an MLM-FREE zone. None of our activities will be a hidden ploy to get you to buy oils, leggings, bags, jewelry, skin care, wraps, shakes, or weight-loss products. There are plenty of other groups here on Meetup and FB where people can find that if that is what they are looking for. Secondly, this is an open, safe environment where EVERYONE is seen and heard and valued regardless of weight, size, race, age, gender identity, or religion. This group is about building a supportive community within our community. We all have different stories and different backgrounds but the one thing we share is the belief that all bodies are beautiful and that everyone deserves to live life to the FULLEST.

Coming of Age Group for Women 60+,0,"Many of my friends, clients and acquaintances whose ages fall somewhere upward of 60 have shared their stories about how they do not feel their age. In fact, many have also expressed how they are feeling a vitality that they would like to cultivate and support in the face of cultural beliefs that those of us who are aging no longer have as much to offer.
As with all transitions, aging requires a continuous integration of the changes we are experiencing in our bodies, within our families, our communities and within our lives in general. In order to recognize our value and maintain connection with the dynamism of our souls, we must address the challenges we are facing in our lives. Grief and loss, physical challenges, devaluing cultural beliefs, changes in self-image, feeling without purpose and approaching death are some of the difficult issues that we face as aging women. Addressing these issues in a supportive environment can help us to re-engage with our deepest nature, discover our purpose, uncover our vitality and express the beauty and the wisdom of our unfolding souls. The Coming of Age group will provide a kind and loving environment in which to identify and dismantle the false and debilitating beliefs we carry about aging and allow for a spiritual unfoldment into the deeper truths of our lives."

In our culture, we are conditioned and programmed from birth with the script of the dominators of our culture. In this community we bond, grow, learn, unlearn, celebrate life. As a result of our conditioning from our society and our biological families, we act in ways and create a life that is counter to our own and our collective benefit. Through presentations, instruction, practices, video, creative expression, group exercises, healing practices, love, play, and emotion in safe created space, we will allow our spirit, our soul, our minds and our physical body to return to our essential state (to our essence) in connection to all (rather than in isolation). When we speak of personal growth we are creating a life that is
 - More and more Conscious
 -Living a life toward Meaning
 - being Considerate of the effects our thoughts, emotions, choices and actions have on ourselves, others, the world
 -Acknowledging the connection between ourselves and everything everyone and everything that appears not us

We want to understand the Earth's ecological systems -- from a non-technical perspective -- and the crises they are now undergoing with climate change.

We want to learn how we can live with global crises and support one another through the worst of times ahead since they are certain to impact all humanity! We want to connect with people who feel the same way -- that imminent ecological,  economic, and social collapse are important and require that we seek to understand the Earth and its sustainability requirements for life.
We normally expect to meet on the fourth Tuesday of every month from around 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm.  
We assume that Friends of Earth Awareness meeting at Humanist Hall will be humanist-friendly people who enjoy scientific thinking.  We show films and slides relating to climate change on our large movie screen and our smaller screen as well. And we have worthy books and articles to read on these issues too, of course.  We encourage Meetup participants to bring their own resources -- materials, ideas, and experiences -- to share. Films and books that participants would like to share and discuss should be readily understandable, not too technical. We have round table discussions to communicate what we are learning and experiencing.  We want to integrate what we learn about the Earth and humanity with how we live our lives in community with people and all the other life forms!
We are asking our Meetup participants to RSVP if possible -- and we are asking for a $5 donation per Meetup.

We'll cover topics like making your own toothpaste, deodorant, laundry powder, finding plastic free options, buying in bulk, food management tips, containers, urban gardening, kid's lunches and the list goes on! Come to mentor others or come as a newbie looking for support and friends. Zero waste newbies can start learning from the manual  available on Amazon. There is a lot to learn, but the rewards are enormous! Zero waste living is one of the most powerful steps you can take to save money, eat healthier and avoid toxic chemicals from entering your home. Zero waste living is important because all the stuff we throw away quite possibly has an even bigger environmental footprint than transportation or household energy, making up 30 percent of your total environmental footprint.  We are looking forward to meeting you!"
Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,0,"Saving sharks for ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.
Sharks are symbols of ocean health. Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean. Until Now.
Today many species are threatened and could go extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.

Small things, big things, doing what we can to make our community healthier and doing away with food insecurities and teaching others by doing so.Not sure if this idea will fly, but if it does, maybe other cities and towns may establish similar efforts.I want the meetup to be about feeding ourselves, our families and our communities, one mouth or many as and when we can. Come, grow, create with like minded folk."

This means that all new buildings, averaged over a year, take no more energy from the power grid that they put back on the power grid from on-site power sources, presently anticipated as solar and wind. The key to achieving these recommendations is to build highly energy efficient buildings. Imagine how it will impact the United States and the world when California, the 8th largest economy in the world, achieves these performance standards!

North Bay Sailing Meetup Group,1,"It's easy to make sailing friends here!  We are the original sailing Meetup group in the Bay Area, and the largest and most active.  We try to offer inexpensive sailing opportunities for everyone.   All of our events are free, unlike other groups, which exist to charge people to sail.  The only time we charge people is when the event is a charter-share and everyone ""chips in"" on the cost to charter the boat.  We don't believe in using the Meetup platform to run a business.
You don't have to know how to sail to be part of the group.  People with boats usually always welcome guests aboard to help pull ropes and turn cranks and pass out beer.  That is called ""crewing"".
The purpose of this meetup group is to promote and share the passions of sailing. Anyone interested in sailing may join. The variety of scheduled events can help build up your sailing social circle, which is one of the keys to more sailing. Educational, social, and actual sailing events will be fun and allow members to meet each other.
Here is a great little example of some fast sailing and what one of our events is like: 
If you no-show to an actual sailing event, or prevent others from sailing if you change your RSVP to no within 48 hours of a sailing event, you could be removed from the group..
Please update your RSVP in time so the boat owners and captains can plan accordingly. This is a little courtesy to your fellow meetup members to make planning easier and not waste limited seats on a boat."

- ¡VIVA MI GENTE!
BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC  provides ways to track down the specific classes, DJ nights and live music nights you're interested in. Just check with us periodically to find different events and/or meetups or the venues that play a lot of bachata... or a mambo ""on 2"" class. 
""Where?""
From all over the bay area, of course. The city by the bay La Salsa Vive 
""When?""
We started with this site back in 2007, and in 2010 we had a boom! Since then, the scene has steadily expanded, with many new venues and studios. The old directory became difficult to use and lacked the capacity to incorporate studio classes and special events. In April 2011, I created BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC to better meet these needs. 
""Why?""
Because I love to dance salsa... and so do you. In short all tropical and regional music will be featured here.
""Where do I send my updates?""
Send your updates to rig@vivamigente.net 
""Can I purchase advertising for my club/studio/salsa CD/etc. on BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC ?""
Definitely. Drop me a line rig@vivamigente.net to discuss it. 
""What's next for BAY AREA LATIN MUSIC ?""
Many more features are planned... but that would be telling, wouldn't it. 
""Who's in charge here?""
DJ Jazzy Jezz is the main man who is a dedicated social dancer and salsa fanatic, dj, promoter…baby sitter…etc. 
He lives in FRISCO, drinks entirely too much has all the smart moves.

Meet other local people who are interested in walking or hiking for fitness and learning about San Francisco's history, including its movie history. This walking group is unique. It is primarily a health group with a dash of history talk for flavor. It is for people in average physical shape who need restroom stops and not for athletes or people with serious medical conditions.
We keep our group together. We go on many different urban walks, in the best areas, that vary greatly in amounts of climbing and history facts. We walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes at a walk's end we have an optional dinner together at a fine restaurant, usually Indian, reasonably priced.
Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley & Alameda.
We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. 99 out of every 100 doctors say ""JOIN THIS GROUP!""
NEWS:  We have a walk scheduled for Saturday, March 17th.

We have already done 15 group weed cleanups which greatly improved 3 pathway/stairways in Oakland's Lakeshore Neighborhood plus one in the Upper Rockridge Neighborhood.
We did our first improvement to a pathway in Oakland on Sunday, May 20, 2012, and it was a success. 3 of our group showed up to work on our first pathway which was between Balfour & Calmar. Then a close neighbor we did not know saw us and joined us in removing the weeds. Our team of 4 did a great job as you may see in our photos. Since then some of our cleanups have had as many as 7 people.
This group is a spin off of my giant walking group ""Walking in San Francisco for Health and History."" Link below:

The East Bay Book Club is a very dynamic group of individuals who share one thing in common: an enthusiasm for books.

Meetings are devoted to various genres, both contemporary and classic.
The club's members represent a variety of backgrounds and literary tastes, bringing wonderful diversity to each book discussion. The East Bay Book Club thrives on both the celebration of literature and the comraderie of its readers. More importantly, the club values the ideas of its members, allowing everyone a chance to suggest books and other ideas for making this club a lively group to participate in.
Since its inception in June 2007, the East Bay Book Club has inspired new and ongoing interest in reading. The club reads everything from historical fiction and literary works to thrillers and nonfiction. Thanks to its members, the club continues to be an engaging book interest group, discussion forum, and social club all rolled into one. The mission of the East Bay Book Club is simple: provide an opportunity to explore the excitement of literature, one of humankind's oldest forms of leisure, and to meet like-minded people along the way.

Please refer to the complete list of current and upcoming meetups to know the books and dates for each meeting.

Sacramento Area Golfers,1,"Welcome to the Sacramento Area Golfers (SAG). We are a group of intermediate to advanced golfers who enjoy participating in golfing events in and around the Sacramento area. We usually play 18 holes but on occasion will play a 9 hole course after work, or join group practice sessions to build on our golfing skills.  We try to follow USGA guidelines to the best of our abilities.  The bottom line is, we just want to golf, enjoy each other's company, and have fun!  Oh ...but we DO try to observe the basics of golfing etiquette.   
In order to play an 18 hole course with SAG, you should be able to consistently hit a minimum of 115 yards from the tee box, make each hole within twice the number of par strokes, and have an average score below 110.  If you're score is closer to 115-130 you will need to increase your skill level before playing 18 holes with SAG.   Please know the basic rules of golf and golf etiquette before you play with our group.   
Being focused on your ""Pace of Play"", playing ""Ready Golf"", and adhering to golf etiquette are very important concepts in our group. Less experienced golfers can play well with more experienced golfers when these rules are followed.  Please be aware of our RSVP cancellation policy:  any RSVP cancellation within 24 hours of an event, for any reason, is considered a ""No-Show"".  Members will be expected to pay SAG for their green fee for all cancellations within 24 hours.  Members are removed from SAG after three ""no-Shows"".

The Oakland/East Bay Happy Hour,1,"Welcome to Oakland Happy Hour.
We meet most Thursday evenings and visit a different clubs, bars and pubs, near BART, and in Oakland. Our target age range is 30's and 40's.
However.....

we do also travel to other Bay Area locations in the East Bay like Berkeley and Alameda.
We sometimes have social events having nothing to do with happy hour.
We also occasionally have events on other days of the week, and
we do allow people of all ages to join.

We're kind of free flowing like that with very little structure and very few rules. This is meant to be a fun relaxed atmosphere. There are none of the following:

No membership dues,
No name tags,
No opportunists with sales pitches,
No a person taking role with a clip board and
No giant banners or signs.

We're just there to meet and have fun. It is not necessary to arrive on time for our events; arrive when you can. We do ask that you please RSVP if you might be attending so that we can alert the bar as to how many people to expect to be there and so I can try to negotiate specials with future venues. Our numbers are our discounts and the Oakland Happy Hour is all about discounts when we can get them.
Please be clear, we are not a singles meetup. This group is about meeting new friends and having a good time. Although I do know that people have started dating after meeting in this group, please do not come with the expectation of ""hooking-up."" If I get enough complaints, cougars and cheese-balls will be booted.
As mentioned before, we have no signage. Please try to look for the Organizer on your first visit. We never put up a sign but are always easy to find with very little effort. you just have to ask. I have found that people in this group are incredibly friendly and very easy to talk to. You just have to show up and order a drink.
Occasionally an organizer tip box may come out to help pay for the website maintenance. Please feel free to contribute only if you had a good time and it will not impede the purchase of your next drink.
Cheers,
Rick"

The Bay Area Sushi & Sake Aficionado Group,1,"Meet other sushi and sake addicts in your area! We'll try different sushi places around the peninsula, attack the fish, drink up some sake, and then rattle our blah blah of what we think about the restaurant - or life in general....
The event limit is 15 people (occasionally more if venue capacity allows), depending on the place, we might have to sit in separate tables (hardly any sushi place can accommodate 15 people in one table). We order a few things and share with our table mates. I will split the check (whatever remaining balance beyond the prepaid fee), divide the food + tax + tips equally and clean up your wallet. Drinks will be paid separately to be fair for those who don't drink but still would like to get fishy.
I am taking the group on average 3-5 times a month cruising up and down from San Jose to San Francisco, coast to inland from the Peninsula to East Bay, to explore legendary sushi and sake spots, hidden gems, and unexpected findings. This is for some serious and adventurous sushi fanatics, needless to say ""California Roll"" and ""Cream Cheese"" are not in our vocabularies, although we'd welcome some eccentric blends. Join this Meetup if you fit the profile ;-)

4. Have a great time, meet new friends

The San Francisco Bay Area CHOCOLATE Meetup,1,"What food inspires passion and excitement in your? If you say, ""chocolate,"" then this is the Meetup group for you.
Meet with people who love chocolate? eating it, tasting it, trying it, cooking with it, and living with really great chocolate.

Really! Suggest something!
And when it comes to Board Games...I am often asked ""What kind of Games do you play?""  A pretty accurate answer to ""What kind of board games do we play"" is:  ""Euro-Strategy games, as found on BoardGamesGeek.com.""
That is not necessarily the most helpful answer, tho.  The actual range of games vary from super-simple (learn in 5 minutes, play in 10 minutes) to very involved (learn in 45 minutes, play in 4 hours, takes a dozen games before you really ""get it"")...So, chances are if you think to yourself ""I like playing board games""...you'll probably find someone here who likes what you like :-)
***Check our Calendar!***
There's so many events per month, it's the only way to know what's coming up! We're all busy professionals, normal people, who want to make the most of our time away from work. We want to do more with our evenings than just sip a drink and check out the cuties in a bar. We want to take a break from trying to hook-up and just have fun together. Since we're not focused on trying to hook-up, single people and coupled people and even N-tupled people can freely join in and we'll all enjoy greater fun.
Many Events are in private home venues, for a very relaxed and comfortable interaction. These events include food, drink, and always interesting people.
If you have an interesting event you'd like to run or host, please contact me (Paul++) and we'll find a way for you to run an event."

We welcome all types of people and viewpoints to share in the uplifting experience of fine art."

Come and join the fun and expand your horizons a bit when it comes to literature! I need motivation at times to complete my reading list and maybe you do too? I'm a fan of classic literature (think Aeschylus, Dostoyevsky, Mann, Balzac, Cervantes, Goethe, Hardy, Faulkner) who has a special fondness for modernist and postmodernist writing (e.g., Brautigan, Broch, Breton, Celine, Kundera, Joyce, Rilke, Woolf, Zamyatin, Pynchon, Acker, Cortazar, Ellison, Pamuk, Calvino, Kluge, Garcia-Marquez).

Oakland Sailing Meetup Group,1,"Meet Sailors, from salty souls to those who have never tried it, join us and go sailing. Our group often includes folks from our sponsors school of folks that just finished or are taking classes getting ready to enjoy this combination of sport & lifestyle. Don't be fooled by the number of sailors signed up for the events. The actual number going is ofter much higher.
Oakland Sailing Meetup Group (OSMG) welcomes all (and kids can go, half price or free when adult attendance covers the minimum for renting the boat(s) we use).
We sail for the fun and love of sailing and to just practice. Our fun/practice outings include: sunset sails, casual sailing, Bay cruises, loops around an island, sail to SF city front. Try a sail to an island raft-up or a photography sailing tour of San Francisco Bay. We often enjoy great foody pot-luck BBQs either at Afterguard's site or on a raft-up of boats.
Want to GO SAILING - It is easy to get aboard a boat with OSMG - there are lots of boats. Our primary sponsor is a professional sailing school with a foundation arm that links to the Sea Scouts, Vets and many ages of kids plus Meetup. This is why our Meetup has access to many boats. We do pay to use the boats, but way less than the cost for privately owned yachts placed in charter.
Event cuts offs are set as close to the sailing event as possible. If at the last minute. turns out you can go - just call the posted numbers. Won't check email if close to ""cast off"" point. You don't want to miss the boat.
Members: If you have an idea for a sail or group event - email it in. This is your group too.
April-October 6-8:30 pm we sail every Wed. Some years we host wine or beer tasting and foodie events to follow sailing. In Nov-Mar is when there are more raft ups on weekends and other kinds of sails that follow with the many holidays.
Want to learn to sail? We meet at Afterguard Sailing Academy - the Bay Area's most affordable professional sailing school - the little school with heart. As a school Afterguard does specialize in setting up classes for friends, couples and families on the same boat. Sounds like 'Dah' yet many professional schools force families or couple to separate to different boats to learn. Sailing for Afterguard is a shared sport - learning how to share sailing, as a family, friend, couples, family or co-workers can help to get things done. Afterguard enjoys the reputation as the school that provides the best sailing education for your money. See the sponsor tab to learn more about Afterguard.
Oakland Sailing Meetup Group started in 2008. We are still sailing and loving it."

Again, welcome to the Vallejo/Benicia area and to our group!
Sincerely, Scott and the Vallejo/Benicia Area Newcomers Organizers (VBAN) and Hosts
P.S.
Membership dues are just $5 per year, to cover the fees that Meetup charges us, as well as any additional expenses such as fliers, signs, etc. If you have any trouble with paying online through Meetup, please contact me to arrange an alternate method. The dues for now are voluntary but I hope you'd like to contribute as the cost to meetup.com is almost $200 per year for the organizer and if there is some extra (there hasn't been as of yet) we'd like to put that toward events for those in need or those without perhaps, or maybe advertising or party accessories or games perhaps for the group events/activities. 
If you want to suggest/host a meetup, please follow these guidelines:
- You must be an ACTIVE member, and have attended at least TWO events where at least one of the regular VBAN organizers also attended, and we've had a chance to get to know you. This is to ensure everyone's continued FUN and SAFETY! As a general rule, it is not a good idea to email people from the group without their permission, and especially don't make others uncomfortable. Please share your real name (first only is ok) and share a picture of you (not just your animals or a sunset for example) in your profile so we can all have a deeper level of safety. Thank you for your understanding!
- If your suggested event is approved (usually they are!), it will be announced as an official meetup and the rest of the group will automatically be notified. Usually the only reason it would not be approved is if we don't know you yet, or the event conflicts with another proposed event. Again, thank you for your understanding!
- This particular group has a lot of people who are new to the area, and quite often are new to the whole ""meetup"" concept itself. So, in your meetup description, state clearly, where and when you will meet, how long you will be in the meeting spot, and how they can find you. Try to think of questions a new person might have, and include that information in your description.
If you do not wish to host the event, and you are just letting people know about something interesting that is happening, include ""No-host event"" in the title.
- If you ARE hosting an event, please bring a ""meetup"" sign with you that is large enough to be seen clearly, and display it or hold it so that new members can find you easily. You can ""google"" the word ""meetup"" and print out the logo. Usually a half-sheet of cardstock, with the logo printed on the bottom half is good. You can then fold it in half and it will stand up by itself on a table.
See you soon!

SF Bay Sailing Meetup Group,1,"A place for Skippers and Crew to ""Meetup"" and share a safe, enjoyable day on the water while practicing sailing skills and learning more about boats, sailing and the sea.
And, of course, we are the newest, classiest and best looking sailing meetup group in the Bay Area. ;-)
If you have taken a small boat sailing or basic keel-boat class and would like to get some experience actually working a sailboat on the Bay, then this Meetup group is for you. Don't be offended by being called a Newbie, sharing our love of sailing is what we enjoy most.
While it should not need to be said, please know that everyone is welcome here. Being chosen for an event is completely based on order of sign-up and confirmation. 
When you sign up for an event, you must be serious about attending. You may not sign up as ""something that you might like to do"" and then decide at the last minute that you would rather do something else. With other Meetup groups this might be totally acceptable. But here if you take a spot, that someone else would have gladly filled, and don't show up, you have deprived someone else of the opportunity to enjoy a day on the Bay - so you will be removed from the group (even if you have paid for the event).
Oh, and if you act creepy, or make other members uncomfortable, you are out, period. No appeal. If you feel that someone is acting inappropriately, please let me (or Meetup) know.
Yes, we charge for most events. If you think that we make a profit, you are bad at math. The small donations towards expenses that you make do not come close to paying the substantial costs involves in operating and maintaining the boats, but they certainly help and they make doing what we do possible. If you bail on an event at the last minute please do not expect a refund, unless we are able to fill your seat.
Always answer the contact information questions when you sign up or you will not be considered and we cannot confirm your reservation.
Lastly, please keep coming back to the site to check and see if you have been selected to attend. If you have been selected you will receive further information on who, what, when and where. But if you have not been selected, you will not be contacted at all. It would be great if we could do this, but it is everything that we can do just to organize the event and keep the attendees informed. Thank you for your understanding on this one.
Notice: Please be aware that while the State of California may view possession of Marijuana as legal, the United States Government and the U.S. Coast Guard does not. You may not bring marijuana (or any other illegal drugs) onto our vessels. This is not debatable. 
Be assured that the Captains that participate in this Meetup Group are Licensed by the United States Coast Guard which involves extensive training and many years of experience. The boats are well maintained and equipped and we all carry commercial insurance. This is very different than all the other groups who do not have licensed Captains, nor the proper insurance (although many of these people do describe themselves as ""Captains""). If anyone asks you for money to attend a sailing event, ask to see their USCG Captain's license.
We put an emphasis on safety here, but we do want you to have an enjoyable time as well. So, please do understand that we will ask you to wear a life jacket (they are brand new and comfortable), but do come ready to have a great time. Thank you. 
Let's go sailing and have some fun."

Usually we'll try and hit up a good happy hour to get the most from our recession hit bucks. Though it's more about the socializing than the drinking. To find us look for a meet-up sign.
As always these events are dependent on getting enough people coming to make it worth my while. So hope you can make it!"
The Roseville Women's Book Club,1,"Welcome to The Roseville Women's Book Club! We are a group of women (all ages are welcome!) that get together to discuss books! It's that simple! We are a very casual and informal book club, meaning that it's just very relaxed. There is no set outline for our meetings, we just talk! We laugh a lot and have fun! Our meetings usually last about 30 minutes to an hour, but the meeting can go longer for those members who continue to hang out and just talk. We also host events that have nothing to do with books at all! Movies, lunch, theater! We hope that members can build some really great friendships through the group so we try and do a non-book related event every month. To get a better idea of what we're about, please take a moment to read the About Us page (located in the ""Pages"" tab), where you will find more information about how the group operates, a list of books that we have read, and a list of other fun events that we have done.
***Disclaimer*** The Roseville Women's Book Club is a casual, informal book club. I usually do not bring discussion questions to the meetings, but members are welcome to bring them if they like. Our meetings are a mixture of discussing the book and socializing with one another. Some discussions/meetings last longer than others and are always intermixed with off topic, social conversation. If you are seeking a more formal book club, with lengthy, in depth, serious discussions, this may not be the book club for you. If you're looking for a book club that is less intimidating and more casual in discussion, then we may be the perfect fit. If you're not sure, please join and try us out.

"Sailing SF & Wine Country: Potluck, Hiking, GIANT's Baseball",1,"Meetup with other fun and outgoing people interested in sailing and misc. unique fun!  We primarily sail-cruise on a comfortable sailboat for some super fun, unique, social activities.  No sailing experience is necessary! Each Meetup will include: sailing, motor cruising, and a potluck meal. From time to time let's enjoy a stop over on land mid-day at either: d/t Sausalito, Sam's in Tiburon, Angle Island for picnic & croquet, McCovey Cove in SF for Giant's baseball games, anchor at some awesome secret beaches to relax in warm coves, cruise the SF City front, and take part in the many festival / holiday events on the bay. Also, for the more adventurous people join us for some of our big Adventure Outings / Excursions - Yoga at Sea, ""Yacht-Golf"", and enjoying beach toys (like inflatable tubes). The sailboats are well built, comfortable, in great condition, and have big canvas dodgers (windshield) and bimini (top) to keep us out of the sun and wind if desired.  All vessels carry up to 6 guests plus the Captain. The boat is set-up for single-handed sailing, but everyone is invited to have a turn on the Helm (steering) or help out with the lines and sails (tacking and gybing)!  The Capt. is a UCGC credentialed operator 100 Ton vessel & 100 miles offshore - also an ASA Sailing Instructor.  Occasionally when the weather isn't great for sailing we utilize the group's limousine for fun, FREE WINE tasting trips to Napa & Sonoma Wine Country, wow!"

San Francisco's Adventurous Young Professionals,1,"This group is for like minded individuals in the San Francisco bay area who are interested in seeing what the city has to offer. We'll have social gatherings during the week, and on the weekends we'll plan trips outside of the city or just gather for a BBQ in the park.
This group is for young professionals around their Mid 20's to Mid 30's. I'd love to have people who are entrepreneurial at heart and want to meet others who are just passionate about their work as they are about their social life. We'll do more than just meet at social gatherings. I'd also like to setup events in where we can expand our professional network and attend interesting lectures and conferences on topics of interest, whether it's global warming, Web 2.0, micro financing, or the latest art scene to hit the streets, I'd like this to be an eclectic group of people.
Some of the activities that I plan to coordinate include:
- Happy Hours - Day trip to Sonoma/Napa - Bike Ride to Marin Headlands - Weekend hiking trip to Yosemite - Group urban adventure races - Weekend brunches - Financial planning seminars - Snowboarding/Skiing trip to Tahoe - Trip to De Young Museum / Academy of Sciences - Art Gallery openings - Craft workshops  Feel free to message me with your ideas on events to that we should host as a group."
The Indian Thing - Revamped!!,1,"The Indian Thing!! - Is a group for women in their 20s and 30s interested in Indian Culture. In this group we will do all things fun from Indian Culture as well as rest of the world.
The basic idea of this group is to encourage members to share with the rest of the group what they find most interesting and would love to do it with this group - Restaurants, Cafes, Plays, Concerts, Hiking trails, Cultural festivals, all those hole-in-the-wall places you love to go - Just make it into an event with this group. If you need help hosting this event you can ask others to help organize it with you.
Come join this group if you love to meet new people and enjoy doing new things. This is a place where we can form lasting friendships and above all share a good laugh.
RULES, RULES, RULES: Yes we need them :)
The success of the group depends on the joint efforts of its members. Below are some pointers to help us achieve the same:
i) Please be courteous to the event planners time and efforts, if you cannot make it to the event change yours RSVP from YES to NO, ahead of time. This allows other members to join the event.
ii) If you have RSVPed 'YES' for an event have 3 'No Shows' in a 365 day period, you will be removed from the group. Changing the RSVP from YES to NO in last 4 hour period of the event will be considered 'No Show'.
If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to come, do not hesitate to let the organizers/event host know.
iv) We do understand your privacy concerns but do try to post a legitimate picture on your profile, especially if you are hosting an event. This helps other members to recognize you.
v) New applicants who do not have profile description or photo would not be accepted to the group, it is difficult to know if you are joining this group for legitimate reasons without that information.
vi) Lastly but most importantly:
If you are organizing an event through some other sources please do not make it an event on this meetup. This meetup is only for organizing events that you want to attend with members of this group. No promotional event please. Those events will be removed.
DISCLAIMER:   The organizer reserves the right to say No. This group assumes ABSOLUTELY NO responsibility, including but not limited to injury or loss of any kind/form due to the use of information, or participating in activities found on this group/site.

Sisters In Arms - Single Moms,1,"Are you a single mom or pregnant and single?
Join us as we share the joys and struggles of single motherhood!
Single moms have to do it all -- we have to be both the mother AND the father, the nurturer and disciplinarian, teacher, friend and provider. Sometimes, it's hard not to look around at the couples with or without kids and feel like no one understands what you are going through.
Sisters In Arms - Single Moms is a social/support networking community for ""solo moms"" to meet and form close connections with other moms in similar situations. This group encourages social and professional networking, and the sharing/exchange of ideas, tips and experiences with others who understand (and may actually be experiencing many of the same issues as you) in a compassionate, empowering atmosphere. Through our meetups, informal gatherings and friendly discussions, we address ALL topics pertaining to single motherhood (such as child support, raising children of all ages, first-time moms, pregnancy, dating/intimacy and co-parenting with exes, to name a few) -- no topic is EVER taboo! We pride ourselves on the fact that our community is full of supportive, non-judgmental ""Sisters"" who are there for you when you need someone to vent your frustrations to...
As Sisters In Arms, our main goal is to support one another and share in the laughter and fun that may have fallen to the wayside while we were focusing on being ""Super Mom."" We encourage those who may be feeling alone on their journey to attend one of our meetups -- we guarantee that you will walk away from the event with some new found friends!
We have several meetups* and outings scheduled each month, so please check our site/calendar regularly for event details. Although we are primarily based in the South Bay, we do try to schedule meetups all around the Bay Area, to accommodate the locational diversity of our community.
If you are interested in joining our group, please read our ""About Us"" page to learn more, and to familiarize yourself with our group policies.
*The majority of our meetups are child and ""framily"" (female friends or family) members friendly. Designated ""Moms Only"" events are open to Sisters and any female friends or family members, and ""Moms & Friends"" events are open to Sisters and male or female friends and family members.
We are now on Facebook!  You must be an approved member of this group to be approved for our FB group.  You can find us at: "
!The Good Life!............... for people 30ish to 50ish,1,"We are a social group of people, mostly 30ish to 50ish, who want to, and realize, we live The Good Life!
Most events are social in nature. We are open to singles, couples, and in between. We will do activities such as mingling over wine or cocktails and are focused on making friends, or things like dancing, hikes, movies, concerts, lunches, picnics, street fairs, community service projects, workshops, etc. We want to attract people with good social skills that are fun and friendly, young at heart, active, easy going, and adventurous for events in the South Bay, Peninsula, and Greater Bay Area.   So, if you want to live The Good Life, make more friends, and do fun activities, come join us!!!   In trying to keep it fun and friendly, as organizer, I'm very protective of the overall group atmosphere. So, here's a short list of people that should skip our group.  1. Creepy men that are too touchy with women they have just met.  2. People who don't get the concept of friends, and instead are stalkers, players or drama queens.  3. Party crashers, who crash closed RSVP parties making it too crowded.  4. People not interested in friendships, who join just to send spam about their book, band, Amway, etc.   All these people get deleted from the group fast."

Milpitas Social Group (MSG),1,"First and foremost, we wanted to create a place where everyone in the Bay Area can meet and make new friends doing something fun.   
This group is for all ages over 18!!!
WHAT WE DO? We do things around the Bay Area (from San Francisco to Santa Barbara):

We eat: dinners, pot lucks, happy hours, parties with food
We have fun: zip lines, paddle boats, beach parties, camping, treat yourself to a massage/spa treatment, holiday parties, monopoly board games, social dances
We get fit: hiking, walking, dancing
We improve our relationship potentials: dating games, meeting new people, practicing our flirting skills, figuring out what we want in potential mates, learning how to attract the right people

We want this group to be a positive and safe place where you can explore your interests and potentials with confidence. For this reason, we are selective. We are only looking for people of high quality: people who are respectful and courteous of others, people who are committed to learning and growing, people who are open-minded and friendly (afterall, socializing means getting along with others, among other things.)
IS THIS GROUP RIGHT FOR ME?
The answer is yes, if you are:

Just broke up with a boyfriend/girlfriend? Well join the group! Struggling with Divorce? Meet other people who are also in the midst of divorce, custody, or support-related issues and need some direction.
Tired of the online dating scenes where you soon realized that eternal texting, chatting, and emailing cannot compare to a real human experience where you actually spend time doing something with someone? Well, we have live and real-time interacting here!
Newly singled and are yet unsure what you want to do with your life? We suggest an experimental period of staying single where you can try a variety of new things, make new friends, gain new attitudes etc... You just need to find what is really right for YOU!
Interested in making yourself attractive to potential mates? Your first mission should be to figure out what makes you happy as a single person and learning to enjoy life to its fullest extent while making plenty of friends out there on the trails, at the dinner parties or our other fun events.
Wanting to get out of a rut? If you picture yourself as always being alone, miserable or whatever then your subconscious will see to it that you do things to keep you that way. BUT, if you can visualize yourself as having fun, being with other people and happier, then your subconscious will work to make positive things happen helping to boost your confidence, increase your potential, and making you the fun, interesting and attractive person that you were meant to be.

Remember, ""because you are alive, everything is possible!""
Thich Nhat Hanh
DO IT NOW! By signing up, you are telling yourself that there is absolutely no need to be miserable. As most people spend more time planning a weekend than they do planning the rest of their life, you can go against the norm and plan for the rest of your life by spending your weekends with us!

Peninsula Dames Read-n-Eat Book Club,1,"Good books and good food go hand in hand, I think! A not-taken-too-seriously sort of women's book group that also shuns your everyday ""chicklit"" - not because some aren't romping good reads but they don't exactly warrant full discussion.
Meetings take place at a restaurant or establishment so we can all try new places. Also, if you don't quite get around to finishing the book (or reading it for that matter...no worries!).  Just feel free to come to the meetings and socialize too.  Quarterly, we may meet at a members house for a potluck meet up to enjoy new recipes!"

When a daughter loses her mother, she joins an unexpected, undesired ""club.""

A note about the application process:
Generally what we're looking for through the application is some idea of your personality and how you self-identify as a geek. For best results, please answer all application questions (a short sentence per answer is fine) and make sure your application and Meetup profile include at least three of the following criteria:  A user name that looks like a real, human name A photo of yourself Creative application answers (questions 1-3) Specific geeky activities you want to do with us (question 4) Refer to yourself as female in some way Belong to other meetups that are female-centric Have geeky activities in your Meetup interests
If you do decide to reapply, also consider revealing a bit more about yourself on Meetup.com. Having your real-life photo, list of Meetups joined, or list of Meetup interests visible gives us more to work with when judging whether you are a fit for our group. (Essentially we're trying to avoid bots.) Thank you for your interest!   The Leadership Team reserves final judgment on whether to approve or decline an application.

Midtown Readers,1,"**If your trial period ended, you were automatically removed from the meetup group. Please feel free to join again!!**
Midtown Readers is a book club for women of all ages (sorry, guys!) who seek friendships and share a love of reading a wide range of books. Jesa and Rachel have been the organizers since August of 2013 with the intention of making Midtown Readers a space for friendships,  community, and intelligent discussion. If you are looking for other spirited women to have thoughtful discussions with, look no further! This is a very friendly group, and new members are always welcome (we do sometimes stray outside the book--just a warning!).
Over the past year or so, Midtown Readers has grown into a social group that meets three times a month to discuss books (Midtown Readers), watch documentaries (Documentary Night), and make stuff (Midtown Makers). Some of us also meet as part of the Women's March movement (

Social Fluency,1,"My name is Barbara Hyman, and I'm an author, teacher, and healer. I've been on the Spiritual Path for awhile, by virtue of my advanced age. (Pushing 60!). That makes me sound a lot older than I feel. 
I feel young because every day I connect with my Spiritual path, and my love, which is the energetic frequency and vibration of communication and manifestation. 
This is what I teach about, and what my upcoming book, Deliberate Trust, A Guide to Intentional Manifestation is all about. 
So, when you're speaking about communication, in my book, you're speaking about love. 
And when you're speaking about improving communication, in my book, you're speaking about personal growth, and spiritual evolution. 
So, I hope we can meet, and make a difference in eachothers' lives!
Thanks for your interest and participation in this powerful conversation about living in harmony with other Human Beings. "

30's to 40's Santa Cruz Girlfriends' Club,1," I've lived in Santa Cruz off and on for over seven years as a thirty something and now a forty something, and found that it can be rather challenging to meet other ladies of the same age who like to get out and have some fun! This group is to provide a safe, comfortable space for like minded women to get together and chat, laugh, bond, and just be girls-- while possibly discovering a new restaurant, cafe, wine bar, beach, or local fun event that you didn't even know existed!  We have also had numerous, very successful game-nights!  I also strongly encourage all of our members to suggest new meetups -- your fresh ideas and energy are what will keep this group alive and intereresting!  In order to join the group you need to have an actual picture of yourself on your meetup profile, so that we'll know who to look for at our events.  As a friendly reminder this group is NOT for networking, selling, or info gathering--only for women who are sincerely interested in making some new friends.  "

Ultimate Football Walnut Creek (UFWC),1,"We've been playing UF since November 1st, 2009 and recently completed our 500th game.  UF is a team oriented, competitive and fast paced game for adults and older kids. We play most weekends and occasional evening games mid-week. Games are capped at 26 players.  Occasionally, we run a tournaments.
 UF is not a league; there is no commitment to play.  If you decide to play, you simply confirm when you can and then show up.  It's a great workout and a fun time with friends. Sportsmanship, teamwork and fair play are the most critical components of UF and a must for anyone who decides to compete.  We have a code of conduct and we're serious about it. 
For night games, we charge $5 to cover the fees for the lights and any additional money goes to our charitable efforts.  Once a month, we'll have a GRATEFUL GAME where players are asked to contribut $5 each for charity.
 In 2014, we raised just over $7,100 to help the Lazarex Cancer Foundation (www.lazarex.org).  That money was raised through optional player donations.  In 2015, we raised $2,500 and provided 112 ($5,000) worth of microloans across the world through www.kiva.org.  In 2016, we donated $2,750 to the City of Hope, $3,000 to Heifer International (6 cows), $875 to a local science teacher, $875 to Contra Costa Group Homes and $875 to Groceries for Seniors in San Francisco.  In 2017 we have devoted over $4,300 to one of our own struggling with a serious illness.  In 2018.....
To learn more and get on our invite list, e-mail, call or text Aaron Davis at adavis35@hotmail.com or 925.323.9409.
 How we play:
 1.  If you don't know how to play, we'll teach you.  Everyone is welcome!
2.  Good sportsmanship, safety and respect for the game rules is absolutely non-negotiable.  Ultimate Football is meant to be be fun and competitive for all players.
 3.  We start and end each game as friends and we treat eachother with respect.  We help eachother on the field and we keep the comments positive and we involve everyone in the game.
 4.  We show up on time, ready to play and we keep our status updated if our plans have change.
 5.  Hope to see you on the field.  Ultimate is great fun and exercise!"
Sacramento Sea Kayakers,1,"Who We Are & What We Do:
Sacramento Sea Kayakers is a non-profit organization that is organized collectively by its members. Members range from beginners to professionals, and own all types of paddling craft. We paddle all types of bodies of water including lakes, rivers, bays, and ocean. Recreational kayaks and entry level skills are sufficient for many of the club's events, but some events necessitate specific skills and equipment. Our paddles offer lots of fun practice opportunities for ""new to paddling"" and intermediate flat water paddlers. Motivated kayakers will find ample opportunities to ramp up their skills through our skill clinics and advanced paddles, which when combined with some formal training, and lots of fun practice will help paddlers transition into being comfortable on the bay and ocean.
All dues and fees received are used to pay for things as determined by the Members, such as free or reduced camping, meals, skills clinics, classes and parties, etc. We avoid commercial or political interests, but to enhance the sport of kayaking we do make some exceptions.
Mission Statement:
Sacramento Sea Kayakers Paddling Club (SSKPC / SSK) promotes kayaking in a safe and responsible manner, while making new friendships with a common interest. We kayak year round and encourage paddlers to expand their skills through training with professional 
Monthly Public Meetings:
The club has Monthly Educational Meetings that are open to the public. These usually occur the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 6p.m. at a location posted on the Meet-up site. These meetings provide great opportunities for paddlers (club members and the public alike) to socialize and learn more about kayaking. These meetings are also a great way for new and prospective members to learn about the club and meet other members.
Joining Sacramento Sea Kayakers:
Membership Requirements
Membership is open to anyone.  We have no secret hand shakes or initiation protocols but to participate in our paddles, membership is required, and becoming a member is pretty easy to do.  When you click the ""Join Us!"" button to join our group, PLEASE enter your FIRST NAME and the initial letter of your LAST NAME. We are real people, who do real things, and have real friendships, so we use our real names.  We also want to be able to recognize you, and you us, so our second basic requirement for membership is a recognizable picture of you. 
Third, when you join us on a paddle all paddlers fill out an emergancy contact and waiver form. A PAYPAL ACCOUNT IS NOT REQUIRED, YOU MAY PAY WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD.
We do not have a family rate, or provide refunds.
Event Organizers / Trip Initiators Are Not Guides:  
Although Meetup uses the term ""Event Organizer"", Sacramento Sea Kayakers prefers the term ""Trip Initiator"".  Sacramento Sea Kayakers does cooperative, non-guided, trips. Trip initiators are no more responsible for the safety of others than anyone else in the group.  If you need or desire a guide, hire a professional through a commercial outfitter.
Each and every meetup participant is responsible for his/her own safety.  Use your own judgement.  Never blindly follow anyone into a situation you are unsure about.
On trips be prepared to take care of yourself.  This does not mean that the other members of the group won't assist anyone who needs it, but such assistance should never be taken for granted, especially in difficult conditions. Be aware that, despite all good intentions, there is always a real possibility of being separated from the group.  It is up to each and every participant to know the trip agenda.  Approach each trip as if you were initiating and planning it yourself.  Trip initiators are members of the club just like everyone else.  Some may have more experience than you, while others may not.  They are not professionals; don't be over-reliant on them.
Although trip initiators are not responsible for evaluating participants' kayaking abilities, they  have the right to eliminate anyone who they feel is not prepared with the adequate skills or equipment for a particular trip.  Trip initiators can organize (or not organize) the trip any way he or she wants. Get to know your trip initiator(s) and feel free to talk to him/her beforehand to find out how the trip is to be structured.
Becoming an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator
Any MEMBER who follows SSK Trip Initiator Guidelines (which are contained within the below form) is eligible to be an Event Organizer / Trip Initiator.  If you would like to plan and post trips for our club, you are encouraged to complete the "

"I am happy project - Napa, CA",1,"Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances. According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego: “When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person’s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.” Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity. If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you.

East Bay Ladies 30s/20s Book Club,1,"Back by popular demand... First, thanks for taking the first step in joining a special group of ladies who love to read, chat, over enjoy a glass of wine. This group was initially started quite a few years ago because our fearless leader is a book junkie who was looking to join a book club in the area and found none. After a year on Facebook, She decided it was time to take the group back where it all started. We read mostly contemporary lit, but do mix it up every so often with a classic. This is the book club for anyone who has read/watched ""The Jane Austin Book Club"" and thought it would be great to connect and share my thoughts with fellow readers. If you want to be more than an attendee and build relationships with other women this is the club for you. We do try and host social events monthly. Believe it or not we love e-mail, so please reach out to us if you have any questions."

And if you don't know what to do, just propose your idea and our skilled 'Gals' will gladly help you. We appreciate the friendship of a diversity of women. We know that together we are stronger and happier. Most activities are in central Contra Costa or Alameda County, but we love to explore and stretch our wings, so don't be surprised when we post fun opportunities in SF, Monterey, or anywhere in between."

One of the goals of this club has been to create an intimate atmosphere where members are familiar with each other and there is a sense of continuity in our events. In order to  enable that, we have to keep our group size within a certain number of members. Please be advised that after 3 to 6 months of inactivity in the group, you will be removed to make room for those on our waiting list."

If you're a fun-loving lady this may be the perfect group for you! We are a group of ladies ranging in age, from 30s-50s! And we are all fun-loving at heart!  We are laid back, open-minded, non-judgmental, full of fun and craziness, and did I mention we like to have FUN!

If you're interested in joining our group please send a request. 
We have a few important things for you to be aware of.  Please read before joining:
Membership dues are a very low $6/year.  This helps cover meetup costs and helps promote more invloved members.
We require that you have a current picture of yourself as well as your first name in your profile.   This makes everyone more comfortable with meeting new people and makes it easier for us to find/recognize first timers.
This group can only be successful with active members.  We want it to be a venue for making new and, hopefully, lasting friendships.  That can only happen with members who participate in our events.  Any member who has not been active with the group for 6 months may be removed, regardless of paid dues. You are always welcome to rejoin if you are able to participate and will only have to repay dues when they come due again.
Our organizers work hard to plan events, which often requires making reservations based on the number of people attending.  Your RSVP is a firm commitment that you will be attending an event.  We know life happens and plans change.  If that happens, please be courteous and change your RSVP or communicate directly with the event host as soon as possible.  If you are unsure whether or not you will be able to attend an event, please hold off on RSVP'ing until you are more certain.  3 no shows and/or last minute cancellations, without communicating with the organizer, will result in removal from the group.  Membership dues will not be refunded if this occurs.   
We don't hold many events in personal residences, but it does happen on occasion.  We require that you attend at least 2 public-place events before attending one that is being held at someone's home. 
There are lots of fun things planned and we all look forward to meeting you.  Let's connect and have fun while creating memories and lasting friendships."

The organizer of this Meetup is Jen Seregos. She has been in the health industry for over 10 years in the fitness and nutrition space. In 2011, she found out she had a genetic mutation that made her susceptible to cancer and had to have her breasts surgically removed to prevent cancer. Shortly after that, her husband left her and a within 2 years of that, her mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and lost her battle in 2014. 
Jen had hit rock bottom and through this process of loss, grief, and failure, she realized that there was more to being ""healthy"" than just exercise and eating right. She began to incorporate what she needed in order to have a healthy mental, emotional, and spiritual state as well. 
When she discovered the formula to have a complete, holistic, and integrated approach to health, she regained her confidence and her inner Goddess.
Now, her passion is sharing this process with her fellow women!

"Women Who Dine, Drink, and Curse",1,"If you're a woman who is interested in making new friends and you have a relaxed attitude, join us! The plan is to have frequent and varied events so there is always something on the agenda. Dinners, brunch, scenic walks, festivals, happy hour--we'll try to find interesting and fun things to do.
I hate to start out with a rules list but in attending other meet-ups, I think it's important to set expectations. The best Meet Up group I was involved in only allowed 100 members and kept a waitlist of prospects. The administrator set up basic rules at the very beginning. Long lasting friendships resulted from that group and I'd love to see the same thing here. 
So, these are the ""rules""
1. If you sign up and are inactive for 2 months, you're automatically removed. If you're going out of town or will be inactive but want to remain involved, just shoot us an email and we'll keep you active.
2. If you RSVP and then are a no show twice, you're removed. 
3. We'll cap the group at 100. Please, if you join, look around and decide this isn't for you, leave the group so there's room for someone else. 
4. The yearly fee for membership is $5.00. It costs $15 per month to keep the group active. Once that is paid for, the remaining fees will be used however the group sees fit--a party or perhaps a holiday donation to a charity. Meet Up no longer allows us to accept fees through the group so we request that you either pay $5 at your first meet up or use PayPal.
5. You are welcome to attend the first event on us, if you want to continue, please pay the fee. If you attend an event and then we don't hear from you, we'll remove you so someone else can join.
6. We won't accept members who don't have a photo of themselves in their bio. We want to be able to recognize you at meet ups. It also cuts down on people who spam huge numbers of groups.
7. We won't accept members who do not live in the area. 
8. We won't accept members who don't have a personal profile picture. We want to be able to recognize you at events and to know you are a real person.
Finally, if you are interested in organizing events and setting up meet-ups, please let us know. It is really helpful to have several active organizers putting in events. It's also a great opportunity to find people who like to do the things you like to do! 
Input is appreciated. If you have suggestions for the group, we want to hear them so don't be shy.
Thank you."

Conscious Uncoupling Group Support for Divorce and Breakups,1,"Are you feeling hurt, sad and alone - perhaps even emotionally distraught - over a divorce or breakup? Dealing with an ex who refuses to acknowledge their actions, or to step up and handle your separation with kindness and consciousness? Are you doing your best to surf waves of grief and sadness? Or perhaps even like you were hit by a truck and confused about what happened? 
Are you feeling a lack of resolution or clarity? Wondering how you can avoid going through something like this again? Or perhaps even hopeless about having another relationship? 
If any of these apply to you, there is hope. It doesn't matter if your divorce or breakup was a few weeks ago or a few years ago; getting the right kind of support and doing some self-reflection is not just critical to your own healing, but also the doorway to even better relationships with a future partner, your friends and family and - perhaps most of all - yourself.
I became a Conscious Uncoupling coach after I went through my own devastating break up. I felt all of these things.... hit by a truck!  Devastated!! Confused!  And my ex refused to even explain to me what was happening or why. It has taken time and work - showing up - but I know I am a better person / friend / family member for it, and I will make a much better partner in the future. I feel empowered and hopeful, and you will, too.
This group will offer:
1. informational sessions about Conscious Uncoupling: what it is, how to do it, and how to decide whether to do it on your own or with a coach.
2. Group coaching in a confidential and deeply loving and supportive group.
3. One-day workshops that will be nurturing, informative, eye-opening and healing.
I look forward to meeting you at an event. Events will be held in both Folsom and Placerville.

Bay Area Indian Divorce Support & Recovery Group (IDSRG),1,"Few years ago, I had started Bay Area Indian Single Parents & Divorcees group, the group was community partners with India Community Center (ICC). The goal was to help support, educate, survive, recover from the life changing events and help people find a life partner in the process. I found my love, or at least thought so, got remarried, reasons which I got out of the group and let friends manage it. The old group is still alive under a different name, but lost it's mission, it's original charter and become a party place. Plus unfortunate it is, that I find myself in family court, seeking Nullity and looking for support again. Not finding any, starting this new group for divorce support and recovery.
You can join this group if you are of Indian origin, living in bay area and going through divorce or divorced looking for support. I'll allow middle-aged never married singles in the group, it there intent is to find life partner and settle down. If you are trying to save your marriage, please try hard, especially if you have kids. The grass always looks green on other side, but it never is!
Note, this group is not a party group or a pickup joint. Dating is not the goal, but if long term relationships and remarriages happen between group members, we all will be happy and wish them well.
This a community effort and I would like all members to participate. We can be friends, provide support 1-1 or have discussions in group setting. We could have attorneys, educators, mediators, counselors, therapists and parenting experts come give talks to group members. Is there is enough interest, I will look to partner with ICC again. I'm a First Year Law School student myself and would be willing to help (pro-bono) anyone who reaches out to me, limited by my knowledge and experience. Please do note that I am not an attorney as yet, so anything I say or do is friendly help and any action you take based on discussions in this group is at your own risk. You should always get your legal advice from your attorney.
All members are recommended to maintain clear photo on their profile, use complete/real name and answer all profile question honestly. I understand its not always feasible to have profile photo and real name while going through divorce, in that case, please you must send me a private message with real identity.
Everything discussed in the group will be confidential and all members will treat fellow members with respect, be sensitive to their issues.
This is a group for good people who find themselves in an unfortunate situation, need support and want to live though difficult times."

Are you ready to become a public speaker? 
Do you know that speaking is the #1 way you can get clients when you have your own business?
Speaking is something that every entrepreneur should be focusing more on: 
- how to do it
- what to speak about
- how to incorporate it into your business
- how to get leads from speaking
- how to sell from stage or how to sell from a webinar
But the problem is that very few entrepreneurs actually do this. OR they do it but don't really understand how it can correlate to sales in their business. 
Speaking is something that you want to get some training with on:
- how to create your talks and presentations
- how to own the stage
- how to create a speaker sheet
- how to get speaking gigs and opportunities
- how to present yourself during the speaking gig
- how to gather leads during speaking gigs 
- in person or virtually
- how to sell from stage 
- how to follow up effectively (most of your sales will come in the follow up!) 
- how to present yourself as a speaker on your website and online social profiles

San Mateo Business Masters,1,"The San Mateo Business Masters group is first and foremost a free entrepreneur networking group for solo-preneurs and owner-operated businesses of all sizes. Whether you are a business veteran or a new entrepreneur, our networking events provide for a safe and secure environment to all. In fact, the diversity in members brings added benefits to us all.
We meet once a week for a breakfast mixer and to discuss and learn about local business and entrepreneurship issues. The meetings start promptly with the mixer portion (networking) of the event. Then, while we eat breakfast we invite the speaker of the week to enlighten us about different aspect of business management. Each week the topics and the speakers are different. Then after the meeting, members who desire can stick around or set appointments to get to know each other better.Members of the group with relevant topics will be invited to speak in front of the group and share their expertise if they desire to.
In this challenging economy it is important to have a group of peers and business associates to count on. Yet, most networking groups, like BNI's and BRN's are nothing more than a place to pass business cards around.
Business Masters is different. We understand that solid and long term business relationships are not forged by handing business cards to strangers, but rather by connecting with people and making friends. Like a member previously stated: ""Nobody cares to do business with business cards, but we all care about people!""
Unlike many other networking groups that charge you hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year, Business Masters is 100% no charge. Obviously you have to buy your own food, but that's it. We know that by not charging a membership fee more people are inclined to attend. The more people who attend the more relationship bonds are created. That's how economies are created!
We are all looking forward to meeting you at next week's event."

I really do get along with everyone, but recently I haven't met people that I have a lot in common with, so I thought I would take this approach to meet great people.
I love doing random fun stuff throughout the week, hiking, exploring anything anywhere, trying new things (because that new thing could turn into something awesome or a new hobby), sports (going to a game, watching sports on TV, and playing sports!), doing random weekend trips, and going to awesome events! I'm always down to do anything!
So I want to meet people that are compassionate, fun, caring, honest, and all other types of awesomeness that also like to do random fun stuff with other fun people. And it would also be really great for all of us to expand our networks. I would love to meet people that are involved in local non-profit organization and in international non-profit organizations, but of course EVERYONE (no matter what you do) is welcomed!
There has to be people out there like I described above, I know I am not the only one! If you fit the description, let's definitely meet up!"

I saw Zeitgeist Moving Forward a year ago and in that finally found something that illustrated so masterfually everything I had always thought, the documentary was mind blowing and life changing. Thank you Netflix for adding this to your library for the public to see!
 There seems to be no real forums to actually talk to other like minded people even online, which is frustrating. Most of us know the masses are not open minded enough to even realize why they have the beliefs they have. so really I  can count on my hand the number of people I know who have agree with a resource based economy, I find it harder and harder to relate to the indoctrinated masses.
So it would be really nice to see if we can get some people to join, and who are up for chatting.   And hopefully get to a point to where we can have some regular in person meetups.... And maybe attend next year's Z-Day. 
Would love for you to join, and open to any and all suggestions.

Everyone is welcome: families with kids, students, scholars, seniors, singles, LGBTQ, all ethnicities, people with all ranges of physical capabilities, all religious backgrounds, and those ranging from the aspiring Indiana Jones to people just rekindling their interest in history and culture.     In addition to exploring new places each month, we also have our own bookclub: (we currently need a new host for this, so please let me know if you'd be interested!)

Meeting every 6-8 weeks, we choose our own book from any genre that is related to that meeting's topic.  For example, one topic we had was the US Civil War, where people chose books covering culturally-based war tactics, Lincoln's funeral train, articles from that time, and fiction.  By having a topic that we base a variety of books choices on, we are able to have a more holistic discussion from interdisciplinary perspectives.  
We start out by everyone introducing themselves and their book with a brief description of what it was about, an interesting fact, and how they felt about it (30 seconds to two minutes each).  Then we open up to a naturally flowing discussion.  It is okay to also just sit and listen the whole time!
""Book"" is used loosely to describe a possibility of many medias: songs, films, scripts, anthologies, short stories, newspaper and journal articles, magazines, and art.
Our monthly Cuisine and Convo event:
Each month, we choose a cultural place in the world (i.e. not strictly geographical) and then find a group-friendly, highly-rated restaurant featuring traditional foods from that country. Similar to the book club, we chat about that culture in an interdisciplinary manner drawing from our own experiences of travel, books or movies, college classes, crafts, scanning trivia online, to...well, anything at all as long as it relates.
You can bring books, pictures, artifacts, or just yourself.  If you don't get a chance to look up something about that culture, you can always bring up a ""top 10"" trivia on your phone about the culture/location.  After we finish our brief show-and-tell/sharing, we open up to casual conversation about the culture or whatever topic morphs from that.
Occasionally we will host this with a concurrent cultural festival like combining the topic of Germany with an Oktoberfest celebration or Greece with a trip to the Greek Festival.
Please bring cash in case we can't split the check.  You only pay for what you ordered, but tax and tip will be divided evenly by the number of people present regardless of what you ordered.

If you can't make an event, you can still interact with us online on our group's social media:

United states have been the birth place ( incubator ) of latest technological innovations; information technology; and many inventions.

These rules will help prevent members investing time and money to attend an event to then have it canceled due to last minute cancellations or people not showing up.  Looking forward to meeting good people and having a great time."

Hiking With Laid Back Moms And Kids...and Other Outdoor Fun,1,"This group is for chill, light hearted moms and kids who like to spend time outdoors. Whether you already spend time outdoors or want to explore the outdoors, you are welcome. Most activities won't be too strenuous or serious. My daughter is 9 years old, born in 2007. She is active and loves the outdoors. But, sometimes it's hard to motivate her to go on a hike with just me. Having other kids around always makes it more fun. I think it is important to nurture her love for the outdoors especially as she gets older and the preoccupation with the iPad increases. I plan to do one event a month with maybe some spontaneous events thrown in. Ideas I have for activities are hiking, kayaking, biking (when I finally get my hitch and bike rack), pool days, miniature golf, and potluck/BBQ at the park. I would also like to learn to play Pickle Ball...anyone know how to play already?I would love any suggestions for activities."

DaVinci Homeschool Group,1,"Welcome to the DaVinci Homeschool Group!
This friendly & supportive group is geared for families who are actively homeschooling with at least one school aged child (siblings are always welcome). We are located in the SF East Bay Area, primarily in San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Castro Valley & Hayward. Our weekly park day is on Tuesdays.
We are a secular group that encourages diversity and our members vary in homeschooling styles, religions, political views, family structures, and probably anything else you can think of. 
This group identifies as a community. Communities exist and thrive when all members are active and engaged. We are not just a network or a calendar of events, we are here for the connection. The things we do are possible because we are all working together to make this a fun, caring, and supportive homeschool community. We want to help our children build lasting friendships and at the same time build those kinds of relationships for ourselves too. 
Our weekly park day is an important part of our community and the best place to come socialize and connect with the group. We expect every member to be an active participant and require members to attend an event at least once every 60 days, but that number is a bare minimum which we hope members strive to exceed. Our intention is for those who join the group to also be looking for a community that they can identify with and actively participate in. This group is more than just an online resource, we do need to see you in person. :)
We meet for field trips, art & craft activities, park days, holiday parties, nature walks/hikes, social activities, and lots of hanging out and having fun. We feel that activities for our children are very important, but we also think that it's important for the parent who stays home to get some time to themselves too, so we have a parent's book club and a reoccurring parent's night (or day) out.
We don't offer classes or structured learning situations. To learn about those type of activities offered in the Bay Area, we recommend joining Bay Area Homeschool Field Trips (BAHFT) at "

For the last eleven years I have cared for children newborn-age 10 in my play based creative nature play, family child care setting.

Get Me Out of the House! differs from other activity groups in that there are no restrictions on age or type of activity, it is not a dating group, and it will include events during normal work hours. Also, while the organizer will propose events, it is not meant to be ""organizer-run"". If you have something you want to do, propose it and we'll make it happen!

SFDebate Political Discussion Meetup,1,"The SF Debate Meetup is an open forum for discussion on the events of our time. We have three goals UNDERSTAND OTHER POINTS OF VIEW With so much news available to us, it is easy to fall into the trap of relying on sources that simply support and reinforce our own limited beliefs. The SF Debate Meetup is a chance for you to expand your perspectives and understanding. We believe that when opinions are discussed in public,  our critical faculties are sharpened as we are exposed to diverse viewpoints that we may not have considered before.   DEVELOP YOUR PERSUASIVE SKILLS If you want to be able to convince others of your ideas; if you want to change the world we live in, SFdebate is the forum for you. Consider SFdebate to be a 'dojo' for persuasive speaking. It is a place where you will not only be exposed to opposing points of view, but a safe place where you will be encouraged to find and speak up for yours. HAVE FUN, MAKE FRIENDS SFDebate is also good fun. It is a meeting of minds, and we follow every meeting with drinks , a bite to eat, and some drunken debate at a nearby bar/restaurant.

Freedom Forum is non-partisan, and not endorsed by nor does it endorse any political party. The topics of honest and effective government, sound monetary policies, an accountable foreign policy, are often at the table, as well as other aspects of politics that affect us all, whether it be on a local, national, or global level.

We believe that people can come together to unite on common issues of great importance rather than be divided by political party or minor issues.
Here is an example of unity across party lines on some big issues:

Thank you to everyone who helped work to pass Proposition K on the November 2008 ballot here in San Francisco to decriminalize prostitution! While we were unsuccessful this time, we did receive over 41% of the vote, and served notice once again that our movement is not going away. Next time, Liberty willing, we will win! In the meantime, the ongoing work of organizing the sex work community and supporting each other when we are targeted by government or public intolerance, bigotry, or greed for our justly acquired earnings continues... If you are new to this movement, some helpful additional information and resources can be found on the websites of the Prostitutes Education Network ( the Sex Workers Outreach Project (), Erotic Service Providers Union (), and Californians for Privacy ( Thank you for your interest and participation in this Meetup!"

Berkeley Cannabis Distribution & Cultivation Action Group,1,"Medical cannabis patients, caregivers, suppliers, cultivators, bakers, extractors, other product producers, activists, community groups, attorneys, city staff, elected officials, healthcare professionals, and business owners, will meet to discuss local cannabis issues especially cultivation, delivery, dispensaries, collectives, improving the status quo, achieving the most benefit for patients and community.
Thank you for contacting the Berkeley Cannabis Action Group. We initiated and formed from the interest of 2 current Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commissioners and several local cannabis cultivators and business operators. Specifically, we are currently primarily interested in spurring a recalcitrant Berkeley Mayor and City Council to act this fall in approving a cultivation ordinance and a cultivation licensing process in the city of Berkeley. 
     FYI, the Berkeley Medical Cannabis Commission sent their recommended cultivation ordinance to the Mayor and BCC for review, approval and passage in March of 2015. Excuses given for the delay have been the lack of state legislation, which was indeed signed by Governor Brown in Oct. 2015! 
     Regarding the cultivation licensing process, the cannabis commission cultivation subcommittee will meet Monday Aug. 22, 3:30 pm, Berkeley Planning Center, at the corner of Milvia and Center. We hope then to finalize and recommend a process to the full medical cannabis commission for approval at their Sept. 8 meeting. With commission approval, the cultivation licensing process will be sent to the Mayor and BCC for their review and passage. 
     Upon medical cannabis commission cultivation licensing process recommendation, our Action Group then will meet to discuss possible strategy and tactics to persuade the Mayor and City Council to act in accordance with other jurisdictions (SF, Oakland, Richmond, Santa Cruz), who have all passed cultivation ordinances and licensing. Incidentally, we'll be reviewing the cultivation regulations of the fore-mentioned cities at the Aug. 22, cultivation subcommittee meeting.
    In the future and down the road, our Action Group will also lobby the Mayor and City Council regarding cannabis issues such as, delivery services, nurseries, state regulation and legalization. We likewise as well, encourage public participation and attention at Berkeley medical cannabis commission meetings.

Open Forum : Philosophy and Politics Discussion,1,"An open and inclusive group for people varying stances to discuss philosophy, politics, current events, and more, in a not only civil, but mutually enjoyable manner. As I'm sure many of you have noticed, its rather difficult to find people to talk about these big ideas with, let alone in a productive manner. Its hard to get a number of people's schedules and preferences to line up, so this group is started with the intention of splinter cells forming within it based on common interests and availability."
DogPAC,1,"DogPAC of SF is a registered political action committee that focuses on the health and welfare of animals but primarily issues relating to dogs in the City & County of San Francisco and beyond.
Dog advocates are as diverse as the breeds and mutts they care for. But when it comes to caring for animals there is a passionate bond that unites people in a common movement to improve the quality of life with pets. The committee has been recognized as a vanguard in bringing about policies that benefit the larger pet population and the people who care for them.
DogPAC of SF advocates for the most pressing animal welfare issues that include greater access to housing for people with pets, shared use of parks and open space, and adequate City and County services to protect and treat animal populations. We have strong partnerships with animal shelters and rescues and with many organizations and community leaders who share a vision for animal welfare and responsible pet guardianship.
Considered one of the most pet-friendly cities, San Francisco alone has more than 150,000 dogs that are household members or waiting for an adoptive family. The entire SF Bay Area including visitor with their dogs far exceeds this many which warrants flexible policies to accommodate all.

Sacramento Politics and Philosophy Group,1,"This is a group for those in the Sacramento area who like to discuss politics and philosophy. We have all had different experiences in life, but we always find that political issues are very relevant to our lives and we want to discuss these issues with others. These days, political discussions are sometimes constructive, but unfortunately they often become hostile when people with differing views are in the same room. It is important for us all to hear views other than our own from time to time, and there has to be a way to have honest, thoughtful discussions on issues important to our lives while keeping the discussion calm and polite. In this discussion group, we try to avoid being overly biased when presenting opinions and we will also work to avoid use of fallacies in making points. We expect that there will be differences of opinion, but as long as we keep a philosophical mindset these discussions should not descend into hostility. Many of us also like to discuss philosophical topics and we will have time for this as well and we will probably find that most philosophical concepts have real-world applications, including political. So this discussion group will hover between these two subjects, and we might even at times focus on other subjects as well."
Oakland Social Justice Books and Beer,1,"This is a group for anyone interested in building community while reading awesome books. We'll primarily be reading books with social justice themes, or books by authors who often get left out of mainstream book clubs.

Beer, wine, or the beloved mimosa will always be an option at meet ups. Book club meetings will happen once a month, but once we get started, other fun non-book related events throughout the month are always welcome! People of any & all identities welcome. Only read part of the book? Come anyways and participate in the discussion, we all have something to say about the subjects!"

Folsom Corporatists,1,"This meetup is for people who think that white civil rights are under attack, but don't believe that racism is the answer. Here we can meet and discuss the nature of ethnic corporatism in America, and how it might be made into a more positive force in society. As corporatists, we reject supremacy in all forms, e.g. race, class, religion, ideology, etc. Tyranny of the minority and tyranny of the majority are both tyrannies.
Sweden, Denmark and Germany are corporatist states. They apply corporatism to labor/business relations; Sweden in particular is known for a high degree of collaboration between capital and labor, to (great) mutual benefit, unlike the U.S.'s adversarial model. If the Swedes can resolve their economic conflicts peacefully and without hatred, surely we Americans can learn to approach our ethnic conflicts the same way.
The purpose of this group is to educate ourselves in how we might do that.  Meetups will be based around various topics and presentations will be made."

We work on a grassroots level to understand the issues real people face in their daily lives. We help build understanding of how political and economic systems work in ways that are relevant and understandable to them.
This project's goal is not to promote a specifically liberal or conservative agenda.  Liberals and conservatives both contribute to society.  We count them among our friends, family, members of the community, countrymen, and fellows in humanity.  We can improve society by learning to understand people different from us because we all have shared interests and goals.
This project is also not directly concerned with party politics.  However, understanding political economy opens up new possibilities for policy and political action."

Code For Democracy SF,1,"Who should join: You should join if the recent political climate has created in you a desire to ""do something"" and if you feel that a good way for you to do something will involve leveraging technology. The original Code For Democracy NYC group was founded on Jan 20th 2017, and is growing quickly. I hope and expect that we can develop a great group in SF to leverage tech for democracy, equality, and fact-based policy.
What will we do: We are brand new, so I expect that the first meetup will center around 2 goals: 1. We will brainstorm ways that we can work together to make a difference, locally or at a national level. This can be through webapps, phone apps, novel dissemination of information, donating tech services, etc. 2. We will form groups around projects of merit discussed in step 2 and get to work.
What we are NOT: 1. We are not a debate group. Of course, alignment on issues within the scope of each project will be important for efficacy and unity, but many of us spend many hours learning, debating, and evangelizing already; this group is for taking action. 2. We are not exclusive: Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend and will be treated with respect."

Meetings will generally be held at public venues, usually coffee houses, sometimes in the day, sometimes in the evening, so all members can find some meetings to match their schedules.  An essential goal of our group is to enjoy our meetings in a friendly, respectful manner.   Generally speaking, the meetings will begin with WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND (open to any relevant topic), followed by a focus on one or more current issues or political development and we will try to get command of the facts, the players, and so forth on that particular issue.  Meetings may then move on to other topics.  Facilitator will usually have one or more hand-outs based on factual summaries of recent articles or books.
This group is for people who identify themselves as ""politically centrist, liberal, or progressive"" and membership is only for people who  interact with others in a friendly, respectful manner.

Due to the social nature of our group, most of us have multiple guns and typically we always try out each others guns.  The custom in our group is if you are shooting someone else's gun, reimburse them for their ammunition.
For our events, we have been getting together for lunch or dinner after shooting so that we can socialize, where we go depends on mood of the group. 
Interested, but don't have a firearm? If so, this is the group to join. In our group you will find a welcoming environment for beginners, our members especially enjoy mentoring new shooters.  
Typically between all of us who attend we have a wide variety of firearms and experience.
For someone who is new to anything, often many times a new person won't even know what questions to even ask, we will help guide you to figure what questions to ask and hopefully we will have satisfactory answers to your questions.
We will show you how to shoot ""Safely"" and have a lot of ""Fun"" doing so.
And for those of you who are ""experienced shooters"", of course you are welcome and we welcome you to come share your experiences so that all of us can grow.
For those of you looking for more ""advanced training"", as a group we will be making 2 plus road trips to Front Sight Training in Pahrump, Nevada. Front Sight is 70 miles from Las Vegas. It is ""legal"" to transport firearms on commercial planes in ""screened and checked in"" baggage.
We will either buy ammo at Front Sight or one of us will drive to Pahrump.
We have a ""new sister chapter"", the Las Vegas Pink Pistols that some of their members may join us on our road trips to Front Sight.  
Other Pink Pistol chapters do exist in the United States and it is our intention to link and meet up with as many active chapters as possible. We are about growing Pink Pistols nationwide.

Santa Cruz March for Elephants,1,"Come meet with us to learn about life for elephants throughout the world. We will discuss the current crisis facing elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia, the plight of captive elephants around the globe and what we can do to help them. Currently, 35,000+ elephants are being killed by poachers each year for their tusks. At this rate, elephants in Africa will be extinct in less than 10 years. A rhino is killed at least every 11 hours for its horn. We've already lost the Western Black Rhino to extinction. With only 29,000 white rhinos remaining, we want to raise awareness about this crisis and work to stop the needless slaughter before it's too late. We will also discuss the plight of captive elephants who need us to speak out on their behalf. 
The goal of this group is to spread the word about the plight of elephants and rhinos throughout our local community through tabling, education, presentations, marching and participating in ongoing activities with March for Elephants in San Francisco. 
If you're interested in volunteering to help elephants and rhinos from becoming extinct or from living in unnecessary suffering and loneliness, please join Santa Cruz March for Elephants. You can also contact us by email at scmarchforelephants@gmail.com

San Francisco for Elephants and Rhinos,1,"Join to help end the extinction of the earth's last Elephants and Rhinos.

This is the opportunity for all San Francisco and Bay Area residents to come together to determine creative and imaginative ways on ending the ivory and rhino horn trade in California and the world.


 Did you know that California is the second largest market in the USA for illegal ivory?


 Did you know that China is the largest market for ivory in the world, and has 37+ ivory carving factories and more than 145 ivory retail outlets; a steady stream of ivory from Africa, from brutally poached elephants sustains the ivory market in China.


 Did you also know? Up to 50,000 Elephants are being killed every year so their tusks can be carved into ivory trinkets. A Rhino is slaughtered once every 9-11 hours for Rhino Horn. Their only hope for survival lies in an immediate end to the ivory and rhino horn trade (both ""legal"" and ""illegal"") and a meaningful opportunity to recover from decades of mass slaughter. The countdown to elephant and rhino extinction has begun - unless action is taken now, we will lose these majestic, highly intelligent, and emotionally sentient creatures FOREVER. Join us! March against extinction. Let's meet to discuss ways to end the trade!"

Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,1,"Saving sharks for ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.
Sharks are symbols of ocean health. Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean. Until Now.
Today many species are threatened and could go extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.

Intellectual Property Rights,1,"This MeetUp is for Businesses, Managers and Executives. 
Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. Intellectual property is divided into two categories: Industrial Property includes patents for inventions, trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications. (wipo.int) 
Intellectual property protection is critical to fostering innovation. Without protection of ideas, businesses and individuals would not reap the full benefits of their inventions and would focus less on research and development. Similarly, artists would not be fully compensated for their creations and cultural vitality would suffer as a result. (topfakes.gov)
Great fortunes have been lost due to not having a patent. Some businesses don't realize that they have created something new that can be patented, and that their patent can become a valuable asset increasing the overall worth of the company. This protection allows businesses to control their market and keep competitors at bay. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
1. Physical products and processes using them (any machine, tool, instrument, compounds, formulations, medicines, plants or any other manufactured goods, compositions or products and a methods of making and using any of these).
2. Services.
3. Specialized packaging of unique shape, color or design.
4. Slogan, name, logo, tag line.
5. Written or recorded material (books, music, operating manuals, catalogs, etc.).
6. Computer hardware, software, website or architectural materials.
7. Special design of products.
8. Plants.
9. Original art, graphic design, advertising, photography, written articles, poetry, books, music, audio or video recordings, films, or dramatic works.
10. Textile, apparel, jewelry or any other accessory designs.
Join our MeetUp and learn how to identify, expand, secure and protect IP investments. Implement practices to track and document emerging IP.

How we can use the practice of yoga to address mental distress and create safety in the body and mind.
Getting on the mat and working with the poses.

1). A shorter. all-levels yoga practice
 2) Exploration of current psychological research on how the body can affect the mind (and vice versa)
3) Examination of the nervous system and its role in depression and anxiety
4) A 45 minute lunch break
5) Learning postures, movements, and breath that address anxiety and depression respectively 6) Embodied practice of these techniques
7) An introduction to assessing your mind/body needs, and how to choose what tools to address them. Cost is $79 Early Bird and $99 after June 2nd. A portion of the proceeds go to support the Against the Stream Mediation Center (www.againstthestream.com).
Candace has studied with Bessel van der Kolk and Bo Forbes, as well as her primary teacher, Shiva Rae, and this work is deeply inspired by them.

recreational support group for mental well-being.,2,"Let's take our health and happiness into our own hands! Our group is a variation of the traditional support group, mixing light to moderate fitness activities (walking, hiking, stretching, yoga, meditation), art, and social bonding. While having fun and staying active, we check-in, process our thoughts, empathize, and find solutions together. Unlike what the pharmaceutical industry likes us to believe, our wellness is dependent on self-empowerment! Countless research shows that regular physical movement, expressive art and recreation, and warm social support treat mental health symptoms just as well, if not better than, medications and therapy. Not to discount the importance of medical treatment, the core philosophy of the group is that we must also learn to ""forage"" for ways to meet our basic psychological needs in order to sustain wholesome wellness. We ourselves are the most intuitive of our body, thoughts, and emotions. Together, by sharing fun, love, and understanding from the community, we can empower ourselves and learn to see our unique sensitivities as strengths."

Marin Depression Meetup,2,"This is a support group for people of all ages with borderline to full-on depression. Depression often involves loneliness as a significant component. Even when that's not a direct component, having more human contact as a distraction from your depression is often valuable. So that's the first goal of this group...to simply get depressed people out of the house and into social situations that are supportive of their needs.
Beyond that first goal, this group brings people together to provide each other with informal group therapy. We hope, at some point, to involve licensed psychologists and other types of psychotherapists in this group to help some of us more specifically, but for now, we seek to offer comfortable, non judgmental gatherings to allow group discussions and personal relationships to blossom that help members of the group to either climb out of, or at least have some escape from, their depression.

Bonding over our NiFe traits and building quality friendships is our mission. Let's put in our warm efforts to make sure there will be plenty of support to go around.
Being an INFJ can be exhausting. There's a big brain and big heart in you, always fighting for control. You feel so much empathy and are so giving to others that sometimes, you need space to recharge and for folks to respect your personal bubble. 
You want others to understand that, even though you may be soft-spoken, your usual banter is just the tip of the iceberg, and there's a whole world of creativity and thoughtfulness inside waiting to be discovered by the right person. 
You find yourself a humanitarian and a skeptic.
You are extremely idealistic with a tragic twist. 
You are very logical but deeply emotional. 
You want to be freely expressive of your feelings and your complex thoughts without being misunderstood or judged.
You feel like a walking contradiction all the time and yet everything makes perfect sense.
You're at a loss to explain your philosophies to most people so a lot of the time you just listen.
Your empathy allows you to easily tune in to how others are feeling.
You are introverted and keep to yourself but crave a genuine bond.
You finally sum up your spirit to go out and mingle, and then when you're actually outside you want to come back home.
If you can relate to any of the above traits of INFJs, this is the group for you. With your inclusion, let's create a fun-filled, positive social environment for everyone to bond. Here we value respectful, kind friendships with our INFJs. 
If you're an INFJ who can relate to this description, please join this group and help make it an active, event-filled community!"

Berkeley Lose the Anxiety Group,2,"This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will help you understand the cause of anxiety and work with a variety of techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully helped many clients lower and overcome their anxiety ; I have used these techniques to overcome my own anxiety.
The two most important aspects of healing anxiety are to: 1) lower your anxiety enough to get through the anxiety or panic attacks without becoming frozen or fleeing the situation. This will re-train your brain to stop sending anxiety signals in the situations that previously triggered them and 2) To discover and neutralize the emotional charge from the situations that caused the anxiety in the first place.
We will use techniques from around the world, involving hypnosis, moving the energy in your body, shamanic practices, bi-lateral stimulation and NLP, as well as some movement and breath work. You will find that these techniques help you get past the anxiety and live life on your own terms.
Please add yourself to our group if you are looking a way to lose the anxiety for good."
Discussion Group: Young and Anxious,2,"If you find life to be overwhelming more often than you'd want, this group may be of interest for you.

We will share experiences, advice, and food while aiming to rewire our brains to cope with anxiety."
Sober and Socially Awkward,2,"How long have you been using alcohol as a crutch in your social interactions?
For me, it lasted 20 years. When I finally sobered up, I was a shell of a human.  I had no confidence, personality, or purpose. 
I drank for multiple reasons. The number one reason was to feel comfortable in social situations.
I spent a year in AA.They gave me the knowledge and skills to stay sober, but I was still awkward and twitchy. Just being sober was not enough for me. I wanted more.
By stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears directly, I was able to conquer some of my phobias, but I am still a work in progress.
For 5 years, I have done it alone.  It fucking sucks.
The purpose of my Meetup to bring together people that have abused drugs and alcohol in the past, and now that they're sober they lack social skills. 
I would like to create a safe space for people to build confidence, make connections, and improve their communication.  This would be accomplished through members sharing information and practicing improv and role playing exercises.

San Jose Group to Overcome Shyness and Improve Communication,2,"All of the meetups for this group will take place at the local Church of Scientology, where I am a volunteer. You can be of any religion to come. You are not expected to change your religion here.
Are you too shy?
Do you want to communicate freely?
Do you want to have more self-confidence?
Join this group.
It is designed to be supportive of the various issues of life that we might struggle with, such as
how to meet people, how to express yourself, how to start romantic relationships, etc. Even public speaking! We will have meetups and free classes on these topics, and we will connect with each other, learn about each other, and help each other improve in life. We have meetups every week.I hope the result of your joining this group is that you will be able to be yourself fully, express yourself easily, and enjoy a better life.
For any questions, call 408-341-9760 To give you an example of how I got over my own shyness and communication difficulties, I had been searching for solutions since when I was a teenager. The one place I've observed where people actually learned effective communication tools, and where people really improved self-confidence and changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place. I choose this location deliberately. We all need all the help we can get to make our lives better, and this place is a good resource."
Mind Power Development Meetup,2,"This is a group for people who are interested in developing their mind power in a methodical and effective way.
I notice that the problems people have with their mind include difficulties with self-confidence, communication skills, lack of focus, and anxiety, so this group will target remedying these difficulties. If our members want to work on other difficulties or issues, we can do so by request as well.
I have been a counselor at a non-profit organization for over twenty years now, and I am particularly fond of some powerful tools which work on everybody but are not generally known or applied.
We'll do some serious self improvement in this group. I'll provide the framework for our members to meet and learn together. We'll have free weekly meetings at the Dianetics & Scientology Life Improvement Center in Sacramento, near Marconi and Watt. Hopefully we'll change some lives as a result of our activities.
If you are interested in using the power of your mind more effectively, join this group now. If you have any questions, feel free to call me (Tony, Group Organizer) at 916-519-5287."
Panic/Anxiety Disorder Support of Fair Oaks,2,"This is a group for anyone who suffers or suffered from panic/anxiety disorders and their friends and family. I'm a former panic attack sufferer, and now my son has panic attack disorder. He says talking about it helps calm him down. I'm trying to navigate these confusing waters with him. I thought maybe there are local people who just need someone to talk it over with them, and let them know others understand. We can share stories, coping strategies, and learn from and support one another."
East Bay Friends for Social Skills and Social Anxiety,2,"Talk therapy and reading self-help can only go so far in healing your social anxiety, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional family or experienced trauma. This Meetup group aims to be a place where people who struggle with interpersonal trauma issues and social anxiety can get together and conquer our fears. I envision having events like self-help book study groups, gatherings for just socially anxious people to talk in a safe environment, and also events where we will go out as a team and *gulp* confront our fears by approaching people in public events and simply out in public. We are all at different points in our journey and there will be Meetups that vary in social intensity from small, private, and reflective, to loud and public with strangers. No one is forced or even encouraged to go to events that are too far outside their comfort level.
*I am NOT a coach or therapist using a Meetup as a front to sell you my services*. I'm a regular person who wants to take a leadership role in recovering from my own personal childhood trauma and fears. I am open to suggestions for meetups including joint meetups with groups that would be sensitive to socially anxious people."

Meetings will consist of sharing experiences with anxiety, depression, and PTSD; and activities that we might use to help get us through our bouts of anxiety, breathing exercises, and meditative practices. This is not a therapy group. There will be no licensed professionals, so there will be no cross-talk, cross analyses, or advice given about personal issues. The intention is to create a safe space for people suffering from anxiety, depression, or PTSD, either directly or indirectly, to express, find an outlet, and acquire a circle of support as they continue their own journey in overcoming their struggles."
East Bay GAD/panic attack/agoraphobia/social anxiety meet up,2,"Hi everyone, As someone who has had GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder for over 5 years, I know how isolated, scared anxiety can make you feel. But we all know deep down that being social is exactly what we need to get better. This meet up is to create a community for people like us who have suffered anxiety and understands how it feels to have anxiety to get together, even when it feels too fearful to be out. This is a safe place where we can be ourselves completely without feeling embarrassed. We will learn to love and trust ourselves and to share experiences to help and support each other. I totally understand that we all have bad days and sometimes bad month, but I would like this meet up group to be positive and empowering. I believe in the power of hope and recovery, not just to cope with anxiety. We are bigger than anxiety and with each other's help, we can make it through the darkness.
This meet up group is great for anyone who suffers any form of anxiety and its side effects such as depression, depersonalizatin/derealization or feelings of isolation. We will be connecting with each other and doing activities that are fun such as hiking or doing other outdoors/relaxing activities. We will also be sharing practices of what works and doesn't work to help each other get better. I personally have found lots of success through a book I have read called DARE and would love to share any tips with you guys. I am also a big believer in mindfulness and healthy living. I would love to practice and share the love of meditation with everyone, down to healthy eating and anything that helps us get stronger and more confidence with ourselve. "
Social Anxiety Improvement Workshop,2,"Ages 18+
This group is aimed at people who have Social Anxiety Disorder. It's an issue that goes far beyond regular shyness or intraversion. The focus of this workshop is going to be a Cognitive-Behavioral approach to rewiring the brain. We will spend the first portion of the group to learn cognitive strategies to form a strong foundation and then gently explore our feelings of anxiety using behavioral exercises in a controlled but also a safe caring environment of like-minded peers. You are always safe here and never have to participate should you decide so.
I really suggest saturating your minds with good information on how to overcome social anxiety. Having an instruction manual on how to eliminate feelings of anxiousness is a must-have for anyone serious about removing the anxiety that blocks them. A person that is not armed with knowledge & information is similar to a person who has the ability to see but wears a blindfold and is trying - you might be able to get to where you're trying to get but it becomes increasingly harder with the blindfold on.

Oakland LifeFire Laughter Yoga,2,"Want to jumpstart your joy? Join us and get happified!
The global Laughter Yoga movement was started by Dr. Madan Kataria, an MD from India, in 1995. There are now over 6000 ""Laughter Clubs"" in over 70 countries around the world spreading peace and joy through laughter!  Laughter Yoga does not use the familiar ""Hatha Yoga"" poses or asanas. It is not based on humor or jokes, which are very subjective. Rather it combines playful, easy laughter exercises with yogic breathing and a final relaxation. And like yoga it IS a ""practice"", also called ""intentional laughter"", that taps into the mind-body connection to lift your mood, reduce stress, lower blood pressure and boost your immune system while you have fun. After laughing and playing with this fabulous group, you will leave energized and relaxed. How cool is that!
Oakland LIfefire Laughter Yoga was started in 2007 by Annie Goglia, a certified Laughter Yoga Teacher and Life Coach. Annie loves to share her laughter with others with an open heart. She was trained by the founder of Laughter Yoga, Dr. Kataria. In 2013, Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Liz Nichols joined her as co-leader. 
We are usually a mix of ""regulars"" and newcomers. Drop-ins are super-welcome. No mats needed. Adults and older teens of all levels of physically fitness are welcome. Wear comfortable clothing for easier laughing.
Laughing with others is priceless. Oakland LifeFire Laughter Meetups are free! We welcome donations to help with our costs. You can click on the ""chip in"" button on the left, or bring your donation when you come to a Meetup.

San Jose - Manjushri Lineage Buddhist Group,2,"Hello  LEARN, CONTEMPLATE, CULTIVATE and TRANSFORM.  Welcome to the meetup group ""Inner Peace & Happiness Buddhist Study and Meditation Group"". This is a wonderful opportunity, whether you are just beginning or have been studying for awhile, to join other warm-heart, sincere Buddhist Practitioners as we explore Mahayana & Vajrayana Buddhism.  Buddhism is about transforming the mind and discovering the path to true happiness. To achieve this, first we need to take focused action to uproot the negative emotions, destructive mental constructs, and negative habits that continually cause suffering for ourselves. We also need to cultivate virtues in our mind such as compassion, loving-kindness, and wisdom. This way we can transform ourselves to a point where we experience stability, peace of mind, and lightness within our own mind. This results in happiness for ourselves and others.  Our group is under the guidance of our precious Lama Namnang Mingjo Dorje Rinpoche, a very humble yet immensely accomplished yogi, whose sincerity, dedication & guidance is very inspiring & brings the Buddhist teachings alive in our daily lives.  The aim of our group is to provide our members with both an in-person as well as online learning environment to explore the incredible wisdom and application of Buddhism. We have on-going weekly teachings & study groups that provide practitioners with an opportunity to not only learn Buddhist philosophy, helping us to better understand the interplay of cause and effect (the law of karma) and help us to contemplate and look at ways to change ourselves. As well as learn Buddhist meditation practices that help us to increase & stabilize key virtues (charity, ethical discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom) within us, and give us a first-hand personal experience of what it is like to experience a mind that is stable, quiet, calm, peaceful, joyful and light.  This is a very rare opportunity to study Buddhism in a beautiful blessed environment together with a group of sincere seekers. All of us are also searching and wishing to discover and nurture the essence of our Buddha potential. Come and join us. Absorb yourself in this incredible wisdom and create more inner-peace, stability, & happiness in your mind, your life, & your world! Seize the moment!

The East Bay NLP Meetup Group,2,"This is a Meet Up for people interested in Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).
NLP is called ""The Study of the Structure of Human Experience."" It is also a self development practice: Once we know something about how we structure our experience, we can find ways to re-structure it in ways that provide us with the experience of life we would prefer.
NLP is a remarkably elegant and deeply respectful set of tools to uncover unconscious beliefs and structures that determine our experience, and--again, at the unconcious level--introduce new beliefs and structures to our hidden selves.
At these meetups, we learn and practice NLP techniques, and learn about and discuss NLP principles and frameworks. We have had a number of meetups so far and they have let people practice NLP skills in a relaxed, fun environment. We've had everyone from experienced practitioners to those just starting out.
For those of you who know something about NLP, we've worked on anchoring, rapport, language patterns, parts work, and much more. So come and explore!"

The Shadow Effect Meet Up,2,"
 
What is the Shadow?

The shadow contains all the parts of ourselves that we try to hide, deny or suppress. It is the keeper of all the aspects of ourselves that we dislike and the qualities that we judge as unacceptable. The shadow wears many faces: angry, critical, fearful, lazy, controlling, selfish, weak, pathetic… These are the faces we don
’t want to show the world and the faces we don
’t want to show ourselves. Most of us expend huge amounts of energy trying to get rid of or control these unwanted aspects of ourselves. We hope that by hiding or fixing our 
""bad qualities
"" we will have the peace, success and happiness we desire. Most of us are convinced that we are flawed and inadequate so we become masters of disguise, and go to great lengths to hide our bad qualities from those around us – even from ourselves.
The result of turning our backs on our dark side? A life that slips by only half lived. Dreams that are never realized, or worse, that lay buried under years of resignation and shame. Until we make peace with our shadow we will continue to be at war with ourselves. And our outer world will mirror our inner struggle. What we resist persists – and we will create and attract from others that which we most dislike in ourselves. Until we feel authentic compassion for each and every aspect of ourselves, we will continue to draw forth people and events that will mirror the negative feelings we have about ourselves. Until we take back our power and forgive ourselves for being human we will attract people who push our buttons and reactivate our emotional wounds. And until we find the courage to love ourselves completely, we will never truly be able to experience the love from those around us. We don
’t need to guess how we really feel about ourselves at the deepest level. All we have to do is look at how the outer world treats us. If we
’re not getting the respect, love and appreciation we desire from the outer world, it
’s more than likely we aren
’t giving these things to ourselves. This is the benevolence of the Universe in action. The whole world is a mirror of our own consciousness, and when we make peace with the disowned aspects of ourselves, we make peace with the world.
 

The Shadow Effect Movie

The Shadow Effect, a visually stunning and cutting-edge documentary, will inspire you to step out of the self that you’ve known and break free from the bonds of the past. Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Dr. David Simon, and other world-renowned thinkers join Debbie Ford to reveal the transformative power of your shadow—the parts of yourself that you dislike and disown, the past that you regret and repress, and the future that is waiting to be birthed. The Shadow Effect will leave you breathing deeper as you take back your power and step into the possibility of the next greatest evolution of yourself.

"Love, Intuition and Spirituality",2,"The purpose of this group is to learn how to live from love, and connect to your intuition and spirituality. There are only 2 basic emotions, fear and love. If you choose to live from love and inner wisdom, this meetup is for you.
Your intuition is how your higher self, your spirit, communicates with you. It is all wise, all knowing and all loving. It knows the past, present and future and is not programmed like the mind is. Everyone is intuitive. It comes with the human package. Only fears block it. Remove your fears and you can live as the master of your life!
Spirituality is living from love rather than fear. It is choosing to be the loving person you really are. Awaken to your true essence of love and your life can be amazing! It has helped me be healthier, happier, more successful, and fulfilled in every area of my life! And you can, too! Go for it!
The fun and profound events are healing and transformational, because the goal is to to help you to enjoy a peaceful, loving and joyful life. 
As a licensed  Marriage and Family Therapist, intuitive counselor, spiritual teacher/healer and author,  I will be honored to support your connection to your wisdom, love and spirituality. 
Looking forward to meeting you.

Lean Culture,2,"Lean startup is a startup methodology which aims to reduce the market risks and minimize capital requirements by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.
But while the lean startup methodology has become practically a gospel in the startup community, it is more honored  in breach than in practice.
Why is it so hard to be lean?
Lean is humble; it requires admitting that you don't know your market as well as you imagine.
Lean is frugal; it entails making do with less or even with virtually nothing.
Lean is disciplined; it requires us to focus on areas that are not our natural forte.
What can entrepreneurs do to foster a lean culture?
1) Learn lean startup methodology.
2) Practice lean startup methodology where you have control.
3) Promote lean startup methodology outside your areas of control.

"I am Happy Project - San Francisco, CA",2,"Happiness is a state of mind or feeling characterized by contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.
According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:
“When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person’s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.”
Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.
If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you. If you want to contaminate others with your happiness, this group is definitely for you. Visit  for more information; while you are there please follow us on twitter and like us on Facebook."
Santa Cruz Meditation Group,2,"Healthy minds dance for joy! Come celebrate and explore the experiences of a lifetime! Meditate, dance, shake, visualize , draw, and talk to keep your mind and body in good health. Find the skills that work for you!  This is the place where you get to try out different experiences from the field of Mind-Body Medicine. Mind-Body Medicine is an up and coming integrative health perspective. It links our overall health to the connection between our mind and body. Most people talk about the benefits of Mind-Body Medicine as learning skills for good health. Its true benefit to you is having experiences which positively affect you. The experience of participating with this group will positively change your understanding. You won't know what you've been missing until you try it. Similar experiences improved my outlook on life a thousand fold! I am healthier than I've ever been, where it really counts! in my head! The impact of this positive change in my life and everyone around me has been astonishing. Care to be astonished?  I wish I could say that meditation is the best way to start. Its how I started, its what I'm best at, and its how I got to be here. After seeing the experiences others have had by participating in Mind-Body exercises I have to say its not! Mind-Body exercises work faster and are more fun! Meditation is the purest mental exercise though and can become a wonderful part of your life as well. This group will engage you on many levels from dancing for joy to the deepest meditative experience.  Yeh!  Outside of being a genius with a passion for this stuff, who am I? Professionally I am a civil engineer with 19 years of experience. I've loved playing sports my whole life. I am very competitive and fair! I am not affiliated with any religion. Malyn, co-organizer, is my girlfriend, she works professionally as a pediatrician. In addition to our personal experience we have both received training through the Center of Mind Body Medicine in Washington DC. As I mentioned earlier, this training provides alternatives to meditation that can achieve similar results, sometimes even faster than meditation!  Background  Meditation is a label for many activities which are universal to humanity. Even the simple act of conversing with another person can be a meditative experience. Physical relaxation can also coincide with a meditative experience. When I talk about meditation it includes these types of introductory experiences and more advanced skills. I started this group because I've benefited enormously from meditating, and it all began unknowingly; I didn't know I was meditating! To be honest, I just wanted to be happy. I've discovered how to be happier, how to allow myself to be at my best without thinking about it. Everyone wants to know the answer, How? The secret is...this gritty stuff called emotions. Emotions are there to help us, not just some emotions, all of them. The more this is understood, the more beautiful life becomes. For many people, there are times emotions do not help, its these that can be transformed. Emotions are difficult to work with by their very nature. The group is intended to provide an environment to help you with these in the best possible way, have some fun, share some stories, relax, and also work through some of those emotions. Not me you might say? How can you afford the time? How can you not? What would you give to be happier every day for the rest of your life? I just wish I had figured this stuff out sooner! The goal is to create habitual positive experiences, as natural as brushing your teeth before you go to bed. The result? Living more beautifully with each passing day.  Although I love to use positive words like happiness and beauty when thinking about this stuff, understand this isn't about focusing on being happy, to the detriment of your emotional range, sadness, anger, grief. Its about changing your perspective and experience of living, so that you experience the best possible emotion for the moment you are in. Its not about ignoring the past or the future but finding a way to understand them in new ways. Its by experiencing transformations of perspective personally that change happens. Again, the secret is not to study, but to experience. In this group, the goal is to have a range of transformational experiences, some will incrementally affect you almost without notice, others will be immediately life altering. There are mind-body exercises which can lead to instantaneous transformational experiences and these will be used to augment the core mediation. The point is to set time aside to develop skills for making life easier, fuller, with more happiness, calm, and resilience.  Yeh! Again!"
"Group for Depression, Anxiety and Stress",2,"Do you have anxiety, stress, depression, or had too many losses?
This group can help.
I've decided to start a meetup group in my area to meet more people and let them know about the drug-free ways in which they can overcome these often life crippling effects.
The purpose of our group is to help people to understand what is going on when they experience stress or anxiety or have a traumatic loss and how to overcome it without the use of prescription drugs. 
If you are interested in handling depression, anxiety or stress for yourself or another and you don't want to see a psychiatrist or take medications then this is the group for you.
Call Tony at (916) 519-5287 for more information.
Member-to-member Connections:  In all of our meetup events, the first hour is a class about self improvement, and then afterward the members will break into individual discussions about the specifics of their issues and situations.
Affiliation:  I'm a Buddhist as well as a member of the Church of Scientology.  I have searched various methods for solutions for my own difficulties and emotional issues, and finally the one place I've observed where people actually learned effective self improvement tools, and where people really changed their lives to the better, was the the local non-profit organization, the Church of Scientology. It is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place.
Activities:  We'll have weekly meetup events where members can attend.  The class part of the meetup events usually will be lectures about how to overcome traumatic experiences or how to better relationships. 
Interests:  We're interested in learning about self improvement, and receiving and giving support for each other.
Membership requirement:  Members must be interested in self improvement and in taking actions to do something about ones' own conditions.
Intention:  My intention is to provide support for people who would like to DO something about their depression, anxiety, or stress.  My intention is NOT to have a group where members pity each other and then do nothing. "

You can discover how to effectively & painlessly conquer phobias and fears; calm anxiety; alleviate physical pain; create abundance; control cravings & weight issues; reduce and often remove the emotional hold of past traumas.
I've started this group because I love sharing EFT and helping people change their lives! I realize that not everyone can afford private sessions. Also, tapping in a group adds a wonderful feeling of camaraderie. I'm a Certified EFT Practitioner and trainer and I've worked with hundreds of clients on a wide range of issues, both emotional and physical. The results we get with EFT are pretty much miraculous.

Bay Area Sound Healing Group,2,"Resonant Harmony Attunements
The Resonant Harmony Attunements are designed for two purposes:
1. To Create Community Where We are All Connected – When you share sound together, everyone's whole system shares the same vibration or frequency -- brainwaves, heart rates, and electromagnetic fields align, and we all become like family. In fact, sharing sound together is a portal to remembering the ultimate state of where we are all One -- particularly when the sound ends and we enter that divine place of peace where we disappear. We believe this is the ultimate goal, Oneness -- for when we exist in a world where we are all one there is no more conflict, no more war -- and only love and light permeate all of our relationships. Coming together in sound creates this Community, where we are all connected, one with all humanity and life --including everything on the planet.
2. To Bring Us into Higher States of Consciousness – A Higher Frequency - There are two general types of states: a. A State of Bliss – Defining “Bliss” as any high state of consciousness – including that of Gratitude, Compassion, Joy, and Love (personal and Universal). This state could be simply Perfect Presence or simply just a sweet state of Well Being. Of course, music often takes us to such a place. It is even more powerful when the underlying sounds are also working towards inducing the same state, and when you include a powerful Intention. b. A State of Deep Peace – Not just silence (because silence can be uncomfortable), but a place of peace like no other. It happens when the sound ends on the root, home note of the song and fades ever so slowly -- seamlessly melding into the silence. When this happens the last frequency heard remains in the room – humming ever so still. The slower the fade, the better.
The Events include many different Experiences. Sometimes a night might be devoted to one particular type of experience; Often we will have multiple experiences in one night:
1. Sound Healing Concerts – Wide variety of groups based around Sound Healing and Raising Consciousnes.
2. Sound Journeys – Experience the healing and consciousness raising aspects of sound as you lay on the floor with your eyes closed. We play a wide range of natural sounds all around you, including using the voice to induce higher states of consciousness. The journeys often include Crystal Bowls and Tibetan Bowls.
3. Toning with Intention – Most of our meditations are done with a conscious stated Intention. It is well-known and has been proven through research that Intention really does work.
4. Chanting – Chanting songs from around the world. No singing experience required. We often do Kirtan (Call and response).
5. Sound Healing Music – Wide range of live and recorded Sounds and Music to bring you into a state of bliss and deep peace.
6. Sound and Movement – Taking sound into form in the body and throughout the chakras.
7. Guided Meditations with Sound – From releasing stuck emotions and energy to resonating higher forms of sound and light consciousness."

Holotropic Breathwork- Bay Area,2," 
The purpose of this group is to spread the word about Holotropic Breathwork groups to a larger number of people, as well as share when the different groups are happening.  With this group I want to provide a space for those curious and new to the work, to experience it for the first time in a supportive and nourishing environment.   As well as those who have practiced it for some time, have a place and a community to come back to.  
I have found through the years, that this work is a wonderful way of accessing deep parts within us; release the pressures from daily life; expand our awareness of ourselves, those around us and the cosmos we are part of; as well as have a permissive and nourishing space that can allow the healing intelligence within our psyche to emerge from inside rather than directed by the outside.
Holotropic Breathwork is a method of using expanded states of awareness for self exploration, healing and personal transformation.  It was developed by Dr. Stanislav and Christina Grof, leading pioneers in the field of transpersonal psychology.  It is based on insights from various spiritual practices, modern consciousness research, and depth psychology.   An experiential approach to accessing the inner healing wisdom within each individual.
HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK TM combines breathing, evocative music, focused release bodywork, mandala drawing and group sharing.  By activating the unconscious and mobilizing blocked energies, this work gives us access to all levels of human experience and activates the spontaneous healing potential of the psyche.
This work is of value to those interested in the journey of inner exploration, self-discovery and spiritual awareness.  It is a wonderful adjunct to psychotherapy and other forms of inner work, as well as a powerful method of self-care for helping professionals.  Our intention in the workshop is to create a safe and supportive environment in which each participant can surrender fully to the sensations, feelings or experiences that come up during the session.
I facilitate groups in the East Bay and San Francisco area, one day format as well as retreats in a beautiful setting. I can also travel to your area if you would like a group.
On FRIDAY EVENING before every one day  Holotropic Breathwork workshop there is an FREE introductory talk for all new participants in preparation for the work, as well as for the general public interested in hearing about this work, with no commitment to attend the workshop (Please RSVP for this talk at 415.336.13.50)
CREATIVE INTEGRATION is a process of using the expressive arts, somatic awareness, ritual and when appropriate the astrological chart.  As a way of deepening and integrating the material that comes out of the work with expanded states of consciousness into our daily lives.  For those who request them, Mireya offers creative integration sessions after the workshops to support an ongoing integration process.

Earth Wisdom and The Michael Teachings Channeling Group,2," between meetup groups for more information on The Michael Teachings, an excellent article on ""The History of Channeling"",  inspirational quotes and messages, astrological forecasts, monthly trends and more.  And, last but not least, please check out our  The Michael Teachings are a profoundly practical and directly applicable philosophy of life that sheds light upon the the nature of the self, one's relationships with others and on the workings underlying all life and the cosmos in general. It is a teaching designed for use and application on the physical plane, and is very grounded and geared to give each student a kind of map of the world from and through which they may more fully examine, evaluate and evolve their understanding of their own personal life experiences.  A major part of Michael's teaching is concerned with reincarnation, its implications and ramifications. Part of this teaching is based upon a system of personality traits called ""overleaves"". Michael gave the information to increase our understanding of self and others, thereby improving the quality of life and relationships. Michael also intended the material be used to accelerate spiritual growth.  This group is also based upon indigenous shamanic perspectives and practices from around the world, utilized in conjunction with the Michael Teachings perspective for an even deeper dive into the nature of your own personal reality and what makes YOU tick, from the inside, out. Working with our animal totems and learning about the traditional 9 Directions and the Michael Teachings 12 Support Circle functions are all included in the work I do with others both online and locally.  Who Is Michael?  Michael is a collective consiousness comprised of approximately 1050 individual souls who have all completed their lifetimes on earth and have cycled off of the physical plane all together.  They now teach as a recombined entity group from the causal plane perspective through various channels, bringing forth information to assist humanity along its spiritual path of life on the physical plane.  Michael teaches that all is choice, that belief is not required, to test out and to question these teachings for yourself, and that personal validation of of one's own essence is the means by which humans progress themselves along the path of return to the Tao. Invalidation of essence serves only to retard and to inhibit such progress, according to Michael. The goal of these teachings is to develop an ever greater capacity for agage` and for unconditional love in our lives. They also offer their causal plane insights without expectation and with unconditional love and carry no expectations of their students, period. They simply offer insight as they see it and each person is free to use what they will and to discard the rest if it doesn't resonate or ring true for them personally.  (*Note: This entity group is NOT the Archangel Michael.)
Who Would Enjoy Being Part of This Group?   This meetup group is for anyone who would like to learn more about themselves, their relationships with others, the underlying structure of life, the world in which we live and the universe in general.  Bring yourself, your friends and your questions to an upcoming meetup and experience for yourself what this ancient, humorous and insightful causal plane teacher has to offer you along your own personal path of return to the Tao.  I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you better through our regularly scheduled channeled meetup groups each month. Thank you for your interest in this group and I hope you will enjoy both the information and the comaraderie that you will find in our growing community. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about this group or any of the upcoming scheduled events.

Adapt Foundation,2,"The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.
We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.
There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.
The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you.

The family system can be tangled from any unresolved trauma from past generations, known or unknown to members of the family. Unresolved trauma could be a sibling that died in childhood, a parent that lost their parent at an early age, a grandfather surviving WWII. The unresolved trauma lives on in the family soul. This can block us from success, health, romantic relationships, career and finances we desire in life. If you are experiencing blocks that you can't associate to anything specific, Or if you are experiencing blocks that stems from an undefined sadness, this group may be for you.

Asian Get Words Out of Your Mouth Club,2,"We'll be playing speaking games, doing drills, and breaking down different sentence structures. These games focus on quick thinking and connecting ideas so you can tell more vivid stories and better elaborate on your ideas.
The speaking games are in English, but the focus isn't on language learning (although it'd help with that, as any exposure to English would). The games assume a basic command of English, and have a goal of expressing yourself more precisely, effortlessly, and powerfully. I created this group since other groups don't have this specific focus. I want you to develop skills that are appropriate in all situations, not just special situations like public speaking. "

Corporate Leadership Development Meetup,2,"Hello potential leaders,
This is a group for you if you would like to develop your leadership skills. Transitioning from senior management of a company to leadership is not an easy transition. What I found is that to make the transition successfully, executives must navigate a tricky set of changes in their leadership focus and skills. They must learn to move from specialist to generalist, analyst to integrator, tactician to strategist, problem solver to agenda setter, warrior to diplomat.
The agenda for this group would be to help each other through this transition. We would do that by sharing our experiences and learnings in the organizations we work for. This group is idea for those who are in management roles and would like to pursue leadership opportunities (VP, SVP, EVP, C-suite). This group is also for those who are in leadership roles and would like to grow further into those roles. Although age is no bar, it would be best if we target folks in 30s and early 40s age group. We would meet regularly and exchange ideas, information. I would like to get suggestions from group members as to what the agenda/activity for meetups should be. At my end, I transitioned into a leadership role recently. I woul be glad to share my experiences with the group and help those who would like to transition into leadership roles."

Tap into Magic In Your Biz And Life,2,"Tap Into Magic is a group of fantastic Bay Area folks who are interested in learning more about Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT).
EFT often works when nothing else will.  This energy psychology technique has been used successfully on a wide range of emotional as well as physical conditions, including anxiety, addictive cravings, depression, traumatic memories, phobias, pain control, stress, disease and personal performance.
It has the ability to bring quick and permanent relief and can be used on virtually anything with a high success rate.
The Organizer of this group is Expert EFT Practitioner Kate Winch, Kate leads Abundance Tapping Workshops and Teleclasses , she also works with people one on one via Skype , phone or on person.

Sensory Reliving: Regulate your emotional difficulties,2,"We all possess a natural ability to self-regulate our emotions.
For example: after a car accident, or a relationship break up there may be a period of heightened emotions. It may seem like the experience 'will never end'. Yet, eventually the emotional experience of the trauma naturally resolves itself; one day we find ourselves driving without a second thought, or madly in love with another person.  However, for some of us, this natural ability may become 'blocked'.  And, for many individuals, this only becomes more difficult over time.
According to key neuroscience research studies, these 'blocks' have developed in response to particularly intense events or fears.
This group introduces the ""Tipi"" technique.
T.i.p.i: is a french acronym for ""Technique for the sensory identification of unconscious fears""... (well, in French! Technique d'Identification des Peurs Inconscientes).
Tipi offers a very simple process with which one 'reconnects' to the events or fears that give rise to such blockages. This process re-establishes the natural self-regulating of our emotions. Results are permanents, you will not have to work on the same emotion again and again.....
This method is simple to learn and to apply on your own.
We generally think that resolving traumas, takes time. That anxiety is difficult to let go.... I can show you that this is not true.
Once our fears, our emotional blockages are resolved our relation to others and the world changes tremendously. During these meetups I will teach you this technique.
You will learn how you can, on your own, permanently resolve your emotional difficulties, at the moment when you feel them.

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,2,"This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! Visit Eat LIke A Goddess now for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body."

Exploring the Tools of Energy Psychology to Change Your Life,2,"Energy Psychology (EP) consists of a number of holistic modalities that use a mind-body-spirit approach to healing. The premise is that any illness or dis-ease has physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual components and that all of them need to be addressed for deep and complete healing to occur. On a basic level, everything is made of energy, including our bodies, so when imbalances or blockages in the energy flow occur they can result in any number of issues or problems, such as stress, anxiety, depression and more. EP tools are designed to identify and remove those blockages so that the body-mind-spirit can heal itself.
This group is for those seeking more information about healing using these innovative tools. Some of them can be used for self-healing, others are for working with a therapist or other health professional. My intention is to provide an overview of what's out there beyond the traditional tools of western psychology, open to anyone who's interested.
I have another Meetup group called the Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology, SF chapter ( which is dedicated toward health professionals who would like to know more about, or who are already using these tools in their practices."

Greater Sacramento Social Anxiety Group,2,"Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations, to a degree that significantly shapes and impairs a person's life. This group is for people struggling with social anxiety, though there's no need for you to be clinically diagnosed, you just need to know that it's a serious problem for you. 
Everybody's social anxiety is different, and some people want much more challenging meetups than others (or find different things challenging). That's why we have a variety of types of meetups. On the more support-groupy end we do monthly discussion meetups (one in person, another online) where we discuss our social anxiety experiences and strategies, usually focusing on specific aspect of the problem. Occasionally we do anxiety scenario role plays or other constructive activities like practicing greeting strangers on a walk. We also do low-key private social activities (like playing board games) where we can practice socializing and hopefully make friends in a safe space. For the more ambitious, we also post public events (marked with [PUBLIC] in the title) where people from our group coordinate to mingle with the general public. Don't be scared off by the ambitious social events or feel dispirited by their popularity, we'll have plenty of safe simple events too and we don't pressure anyone.
Events are free unless otherwise marked. If you don't fit in anywhere else and have a hard time opening up, we can relate. Also, unlike most of the other local anxiety groups, we promise we're not scientologists (nor do we promote any religion)."

This group is for strong women (and men) who find themselves living life in survival mode rather than victory mode. You get smaller to allow someone you love to get larger.

I was none of those things and it happened to me. Words do hurt. Drugs do kill. They killed who I was for 9 years even though I didn't not use them. If you need a safe place to land and get the strength the grow without judgment this group is for you. The goal is support each other through sharing caring and empowerment.

Let Go of Your Past and Make New Positive Friends,2,"All of the meetups for this group will take place at the local Church of Scientology, where I am a volunteer. You can be of any religion to come. For example, I'm a Buddhist myself. You are not expected to change your religion here.
1.  Have you been through stressful past situations, and you want to mentally move on? 
2.  Are you interested in building new and strong relationships?
If you answered YES to both of these questions, you should join this group.
Having been a life improvement consultant at a non-profit organization for over 20 years, I know one of the reasons people cannot be positive is because they are tied down by their traumatic experiences.  It's hard to be healthy mentally when you are reeling from your past upsets.  Therefore, part of our activities in our meetups will be discussing ways to get over traumatic events, and, if you are willing, share some of your experiences with the other members.
Another reason people cannot move on is because they lack the relationship building or communication skills they need.  For example, they may be introverted, uncomfortable talking with strangers, or do not seize opportunities to meaningfully connect with other people.  Therefore, we will be discussing relationship building skills as well.
All of our meetup events will provide time for individual discussions, so members can share their deep thoughts and personal experiences.  Typically, we'll have one meetup per week, and the first hour of the meetup will be a workshop to learn some tools for how to let go of the past and make new friends, and the second hour will be for individual discussions.  All the meetup events for this group are free, and members are encouraged to bring friends. 
If you are interested, join this group now. For any questions, please call Tony the Organizer at (916) 519-5287.
The Church of Scientology is where I do volunteering work nowadays, and it is also where the meetups for this group will take place. I choose this location deliberately. It is the one place in town where I've observed people really get effective help for their traumatic experiences.  We all need all the help we can get to make our lives better, and this place is a good resource.  "

This group is for you if you want to free yourself from general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive worrying, phobias (including agoraphobia), OCD or PTSD. We will work with hypnosis and other techniques to help you lower, deal with, and ultimately heal the causes of anxiety. I have successfully used hypnosis to help many clients lower and overcome their anxiety and depression; I've also used it to get over my own anxiety. 
Hypnosis is fun, safe, drug-free and extremely relaxing. Think of all the movies where the hypnotist waved a watch and said, ""You are getting very sleepy."" It really is a great tool for stress-free comfort, though no one actually uses a watch. It's particularly effective for people with anxiety, especially worriers, because  they tend to be even more hypnotizable than the general public. 
Please add yourself to our group. 
If you'd like to personally find out how hypnotizable you are, take our quiz at:

Relationship Tools Meetup Group,2,"""CHANGING ME CHANGES WE!"" This group is for people who want to improve their relationships. If you want to make a bad relationship into a good one, or a good relationship into a great one, this group is for you! It's sad, but true: love is not enough. Successful relationships also take skill. Skills like setting and enforcing boundaries, actively respecting yourself and others, knowing when and how to take care of yourself, being assertive--all play a part. I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist, and I realized I was teaching the same skills to all my clients. I created this class for my clients, their spouses, and others to accelerate their learning of crucial relationship skills at a low cost. Learn winning strategies and un-learn losing strategies in this eye-opening, interactive group. And if you're in therapy or working a 12-step program, this will definitely give your process a boost! We'll have 2-hour meetings in the daytime and/or in the evening--come join us!"
"From Surviving to Thriving, ACA",2,"Let's explore Adult Children of Alcoholics/Dysfunctional Family issues and how they might be impacting your life today. These issues mostly show up in interpersonal relationships with spouses, co-workers, relationship partners, friends, etc. Excerpt from a workbook: ""The term ""Adult Child"" does not mean that you live in the past or that you are infantile in your thinking or actions. It means that you meet the demands of adult life with survival techniques learned as children.""
Let's explore the possibilities of transformation from surviving to thriving."

Peer Support Group for Children of Narcissistic Parents,2,"Growing up in a household ruled by personality disorders can forge memories inside us that last a lifetime. These experiences of our parents can be ludicrous, unbelievable; they can be fantastical and full of strange behavior; they can be brutally inconsiderate, with hideous abuse and neglect. At times, sharing these stories with the outside world can produce stares of disbelief - but when we meet together and witness each other, we feel seen and heard in profound ways.
Did you grow up in a home like this? Seeking togetherness, understanding, a chance to share challenges, triumphs, and those weird memories of home that make life hard but meaningful? Come join us to be supported and heard."

This is an informal group not facilitated by a Licensed mental health professional, just peer run. If this sounds like a meetup you would like to attend, please join. 
Mental illness is often a very isolating experience. This group is meant to be a safe, judgment-free space for those who experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. Hopefully we can share, connect and learn with/from each other.

We can do this by sharing what's going on in our recovery process and/or just listening and learning from others. We don't have to be alone in this process. We are all worthy, good enough, and can be loved and accepted just as we are.

""Receiving empathy is a wonderful gift, but so is offering it."" - Brene Brown."
Candor: High Control Group Recovery,2,"We were born and raised in high control groups and, since leaving these groups, have struggled to understand the damage a movement revolving around a charismatic leader and/or elite few can do to the other members. 
Our concerns lie with broken family connections, spiritual and physical abuse, financial abuse, insufficient education and the psychological problems stemming from all of these issues. While we understand that the ideologies of each unique group do have significant bearing on peoples' lives, our focus is to address the unhealthy manipulation experienced by members and not debate the ""rightness"" or ""wrongness"" of organizations' belief systems. 
We want to provide a forum to share stories and ideas, empathize, learn, heal and connect to sources of aid. If you are tired of being ashamed of your former involvement (or are trying to leave) a high control group and would like to meet others who share the same experience, you have come to the right place.       
Anyone who was born into or actively joined a movement -- regardless of size, faith, ideology or length of the group's existence -- and has experienced undue influence that altered their lives should consider joining. All ages and backgrounds are welcome. 
Our members are looking to understand both the positive and negative aspects of their experiences and are open to learning from others' stories.    
Please join our group if you would like to share your story and/or simply listen and learn. It's cathartic to connect with others who understand and have overcome or are still struggling with similar situations.  
Come to a monthly meet-up that begins with a presentation focusing on a differing theme with each meeting.  Topics might include what constitutes a harmful group, specific struggles of people raised as children in high-control organizations (aka Second Generation Adults), gurus and Eastern-based organizations, shunning within groups, charismatic Christian groups, finding professional help, connecting with estranged family members and much more. 
The remainder of each meet up will be open to comment and discussion and end with the opportunity for members to better get to know each other.

Partners of Sexual Trauma Survivors,2,"It can be heart wrenching to watch a loved one go through trauma. With all of the pain your partner is going through, it can also be difficult for partners to deal with their own emotions and address their own needs. You may feel helpless when all you want to do is help your partner feel better. You may encounter problems with intimacy and sex. You may feel unable to express your own emotions or feel like you don't have the right to have your own feelings. You may be scared that your partner will never be the same. Healing from trauma can be a long and hard process. Thankfully, there resources for survivors of sexual trauma to help guide and support them through their healing process. Unfortunately, there are few resources and systems of support for partners of trauma survivors. I am starting this group to fill this unmet need.
This group is open to all who have a spouse/partner dealing with the effects of sexual trauma. I want to form this group around the needs of its members. This will include support group meetings, and can also include going through helpful resources together, such as books on sexual trauma and PTSD. If the group has enough members and there is a need for it, we could also hold separate groups for self-identified men and women. About the moderator: My name is Susan and I live in Oakland with my girlfriend who is a survivor of sexual trauma. I had been seeking a support group for partners of sexual trauma survivors for a long time, but one simply did not exist, so I decided to create this group. I am a scientist by training, and am not a mental health professional, so this group will be a peer-to-peer support group. I hope to create a space that feels safe to all, and welcome feedback on how I can accomplish that. I look forward to supporting each other."
Musical Inspiration & Testimony For Abuse Survivors,2,"Our group meets monthly to enjoy musical inspiration (listening to gospel selections, a local singer, or drumming with West African Djembe drums), followed by testimony in a safe, respectful environment.  This means we a) listen to music or participate in creating music and then b) share our stories of what happened and how we survived.  
This group is based progressive Christian values (acceptance, love, forgiveness) and is inclusive of all different types of survivors regardless of sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, etc.  As long as you enjoy some gospel music and are interesting sharing your testimony of how you survived, we welcome you! "
SF Adult Survivors of Child Abuse (ASCA) Support Group,2,"Our meetings follow the ASCA (Adult Survivors of Child Abuse) format. To quote the Survivor to Thriver manual: 'The purpose of ASCA meetings is to allow survivors to share their abuse and recovery experiences, to receive support and affirmation for their recovery efforts; to try out new, more adaptive behaviors and, in so doing, to better understand themselves and their recovery process.' This is a peer support group not a therapy group and is for abuse survivors only."
Living Positive with Chronic Disease,2,"Congratulations on finding us. The last thing you needed, on top of chronic illness, is the frustration of finding help. Hopefully this group will help.
I didn't start this group and it's not mine. It's ours. Just like the dreaded pirate Roberts in Princess Bride, it was passed on to me after it was passed on to them. Thanks to those before me. I hope I continue the group as it was intended.
Here are my proposed goals for the group:
1. Equal time for equal pain. No one likes to talk more than I do, but equal time should be had by all. Wait, I'm not finished yet.
2. We laugh, we cry, even if you're a guy. Rhyming is not required.
3. Accommodate the accommodations. Sit, stand, or lay. Light, sound, and smells can all be adjusted to fit your needs. Please: shower-yes, perfume-no. Make-up is optional, clothing is not.
4. Too late, too early, wrong day, right place. We adjust as needed to be accessible to those interested in attending. If you don't have a horse in the race you can't complain about the track.
5. Nothing leaves the room. Well, we do, but what we say doesn't. Well, I guess it does, in our heads. It just should stay there. Unless we forget it, which is also ok.
6. All other guidelines to be determined. And determined we will be. In helping each other."
