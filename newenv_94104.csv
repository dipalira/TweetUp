Just look at movies and TV shows from 50, 30, even 10 years ago; how many of them predicted today's world accurately? And why did they fail?

Reproductive Eco Wellness,0,"This is great space for people looking to get healthy, considering or in the midst of procreation, trying to integrate more sustainability into their life, or just plain curious about any of the above. We're looking at the BIG frame of human reproduction - how we (re)create our bodies, our fuller selves, communities, cultures, and new life, within a spiritual and ecological context. We are getting inspired to apply and practice intentional reproduction of all kinds in our own lives. The human body and its energy are miraculous, multilayered systems, and to enter the process of reproduction with this consciousnesss - whether that is healing at a cellular level, evolving our physical lifestyle, healing our lineage, or preparing for pregnancy and parenting - means taking a holistic, systemic approach to wellness. What we eat, what we consume, what we think and feel towards our own bodies, and how we navigate existing choices along the spectrum of reproduction - all of this plays into the ecology of reproductive wellness. It takes a village - and a planet - to BE fully human! This is a space to learn and share about different tools and processes that can inform an integrated, Earth-conscious, joyful life with reverence for the human body, mind, heart and spirit and wider circle of life. Focus will be on honoring our unique paths to nutritional agency, consumer impact/footprint, reproductive choice and education in birth and beyond, healing our families and communities through individual responsibility, holistic approaches to modern health obstacles, and connecting to #JuicyEarth. All folks of all reproductive capacities, interests and experiences welcome. "

SF & Bay Area Zeitgeist movement social consciousness group,0,"At this point the purpose of this group is to gain and grow members of fellow people who see the world for what it really is and the true root cause for all of the perilous issues we face. I saw Zeitgeist Moving Forward a year ago and in that finally found something that illustrated so masterfually everything I had always thought, the documentary was mind blowing and life changing. Thank you Netflix for adding this to your library for the public to see!
 There seems to be no real forums to actually talk to other like minded people even online, which is frustrating. Most of us know the masses are not open minded enough to even realize why they have the beliefs they have. so really I  can count on my hand the number of people I know who have agree with a resource based economy, I find it harder and harder to relate to the indoctrinated masses.
So it would be really nice to see if we can get some people to join, and who are up for chatting.   And hopefully get to a point to where we can have some regular in person meetups.... And maybe attend next year's Z-Day. 
Would love for you to join, and open to any and all suggestions.

The San Mateo Organic Beef Group,0,"Simply put, we love beef and support the overall health of our  environment, but had yet to see a group that combined both areas into  one group.  Since the creator of the group lives in the Peninsula, she  decided to create The San Mateo Organic Beef Meetup Group for those of  us who want to continue being beef enthusiasts in a way that is more  supportive of the environment. Do you thoroughly enjoy the  consumption of beef and want to support the local sustainable  agriculture movement? Then this group might be for you! Please read on  and find out....Given our enjoyment of beef and desire to  support the sustainable agriculture movement, we are on a quest to  discover, learn about, and of course savor, these beef being produced  locally in more environmentally responsible environments. That means we  have the opportunity to meet our local farmers and ranchers who are  implementing these natural and organic processes to the extent they are  able. The 'artisan' part, for me, means these folks are producing  product in a traditional manner which can be done in smaller or larger  scale.....but always, with traditional methodologies which respect the  environment and the animals.We realize the process of creating a  purely natural or organic growing and/or processing environment is  costly, a long process and challenging on many levels. There are many  ranchers and farmers who are doing what they can to gradually convert to  an environmentally sustainable model. This group is about inclusion and  tolerance, so we strive to learn about and support those farmers' and  ranchers' efforts and products as they continue to make the effort to  this.If you like what you read, please join us and tell everyone you believe might enjoy learning we exist, as well!Join us on this journey!"

North Bay Intentional Communities:Ecovillages and more,0,"""The next Buddha will not take the form of an individual. The next Buddha may take the form of a community; a community practising understanding and loving kindness, a community practicing mindful living. This may be the most important thing we can do for the survival of the earth."" - Thich Nhat Hanh
Meet other local people who live in, or are interested in creating, intentional communities, including collectives, co-housing and cooperatives. Interested in both urban and rural initiatives for becoming more self-sufficient in key areas of economics, energy, food, housing, transportation, education, organization and governance. Think community incubator!
An emphasis on creating healthy, high-functioning, supportive community that is in harmony with the earth's natural systems is foundational.
More than a discussion group, it is hoped that concrete action plans to address the very real barriers for creating a sustainable civilization will emanate from this group.
For example, access to land. The majority of our food supply is not local and is dependent upon fossil fuels. We must bring it local and wean ourselves from petroleum. Yet land is expensive and unaffordable to beginning farmers. Is there a solution?
Access to housing. It too is unaffordable to buy for an increasing majority of people, or even build given current zoning and building requirements. Is there a solution?
Access to employment and a living wage. Many people lost their jobs thanks to the wall street meltdown and cannot find a new job. One answer is to start a business. Most businesses require capitalization. Bank loans are tougher then ever to obtain. Is there a solution?
Access to tools and technology. Do we really all have to own one of everything we need? If we cannot afford it must we simply do without? Besides that, the earth has finite resources and a burgeoning population. Is there a solution?
There are solutions to all these barriers and more. Exciting innovative solutions are being devised, tried and tested the world over. Why not here too? If that wheel has already been invented, we'll find it and adapt if for use here. If not, we will invent our own.
Last, but not least, if you are not familiar with the intentional communities movement, please familiarize yourself by visiting our web pages where we are placing links to additional information for your edification. Simply click on the Pages menu item above.
The village can and will return. Come, join us."
Healthy Minds And Bodies,0,"If you would like to feel better, have more energy, lose weight (and keep it off), strengthen your immune system, and think from a higher place, yet you have trouble creating the habits that will facilitate this, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE!
People already know what's healthy and what's not healthy for their brains and their bodies.  More information about how important exercise is or how bad processed sugars are will not benefit anyone.  
What people don't know is how to prioritize which modifications will serve the individual best.  Everyone's lifestyle is at least a little different, meaning the most beneficial changes are going to vary person to person.  This Meetup will bring clarity as to what are the most important new habits for you to create.  This is the easy part...
The biggest challenge for most people is not figuring out what change to make nor it actually making the change, it's sustaining the change.  This group provides the tools, strategies, and support system to help you adopt these changes for the long run.  This is what will allow your health to truly flourish.
The Meetups are hosted by Dr. Steven Cain DC, and Carol Zizich.  Dr. Steve has been passionate about helping people adopt healthier lifestyles since he was a teenager.  He has a focus in health coaching and brain health.  Carol Zizich transformed her health and her life 20 years ago and loves to help others do the same.  She is a Reiki Master and has been certified in lifestyle coaching.
The Meetups are designed to be fun, engaging, and enlightening.  In each session we will...
- Learn new elements of what a healthy lifestyle is + how to apply it (sometimes we will have guest speakers)
- Engage with the topics (we will incorporate exercise when we discuss exercise, we will host potluck lunches when we discuss nutrition, we will partake in meditative techniques when we discuss stress management)
- Discuss how we are progressing towards our goals.  The Meetup hosts will guide group discussions that create a supportive team environment and bring clarity to the next step to take.  The hosts will also log each participants progress (ie how many hours a week they have been exercising or how many servings of vegetables they are having a day) so that each participant can see their charted progress over time.
This Meetup is designed open to anyone who would like to upgrade their health."

Walking in San Francisco for Health and History,0,"See legal disclaimer at bottom of text. EVERYONE MAY NOW JOIN THE GROUP EXCEPT THOSE FEW WHO WERE BANNED. Walking or hiking. Meet other local people who are interested in walking or hiking for fitness and learning about San Francisco's history, including its movie history. This walking group is unique. It is primarily a health group with a dash of history talk for flavor. It is for people in average physical shape who need restroom stops and not for athletes or people with serious medical conditions.
We keep our group together. We go on many different urban walks, in the best areas, that vary greatly in amounts of climbing and history facts. We walk at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes at a walk's end we have an optional dinner together at a fine restaurant, usually Indian, reasonably priced.
Our walks are usually 5 to 7 miles and might be called urban hiking. Our routes are well planned with good restroom stops properly spaced. We avoid stinky port-a-potties. Though we mainly walk in SF we also walk in Oakland, Piedmont, Sausalito, Berkeley & Alameda.
We always take roll and if more than 20 attendees we give all a name tag. Attendance is usually unlimited and has ranged from 1 to 112. Kids and cameras very welcome. Dogs and other pets are not welcome. Also, smoking is not allowed on the walks as this is a health group. Occasionally we visit science and nature places. 99 out of every 100 doctors say ""JOIN THIS GROUP!""
NEWS:  We have a walk scheduled for Saturday, March 17th. 
Our ""group photo"" was taken July 5th, 2015 at our walk ""The March to the Sea.""

Jeet Kune Do/Kali Fierce Egalitarians,0,"""What would happen if a year-old baby fell from a fourth-floor window onto the head of a burly truck driver, standing on the sidewalk?

You may feel as helpless as a year-old infant-as far as fighting is concerned; but please remember: (1) YOU WEIGH MORE THAN A BABY, and (2) YOU NEED NOT FALL FROM A WINDOW TO PUT YOUR BODY-WEIGHT INTO MOTION.

Welcome! We are a group of people who learn and practice the Yoga of Breath as a means to total wellness of a healthy body and a stress-free mind. Beginners, intermediate practitioners, seasoned yogis ... all are part of this group.
The first act we do in our life is to breathe in. And the last act of our life is to breathe out. Between this first breath in and the last breath out are all the breaths that we call life. The breath is our best friend -- it's always with us. And yet, we hardly know much about it. What's more ... it holds some timeless secrets to our health, peace of mind, and well-being.

With just a little practice it's easy to use your breath to instantly

infuse your body with energy
detoxify through the breath
make your mind calm
control negative emotions
increase focus and concentration
create a sense of well-being

We're here to unite groups of patients who share common goals."

Northern California Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group,0,"Hello! Welcome to the Northern California Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group. You are also more than welcome to visit our Southern California Young Living Essential Oils Meetup Group for Southern California support. Here you will meet other people interested in alternative health and naturopathic healing via therapeutic grade essential oils. This is also a wonderful website for additional educational support. Please feel free to check out the ""More"" drop down menu, then click on ""Files."" An excellent resource is the file entitled ""Supporting Websites.""
Such oils are the industry leaders in essential oils. In fact, they are the industry standard oils with massage therapists and in many alternative healing practices. They are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, an emerging therapy. See below for more information. They are also used in hospitals throughout the U.S. They are even used intravenously in the Nova Vita clinic in Ecuador. They are very different than food-grade and perfume-grade essential oils (EOs) sold in many health food stores. Most health food store essential oils and other ""knock off"" companies are either synthetic, a few molecules are changed, cut with alcohol and other ingredients or are distilled quickly at high temperatures for fast, mass production, hence making the oils more affordably appealing, yet with no healing properties. Young Living Essential Oils are true therapeutic-grade EOs. In fact, Gary Young coined the term therapeutic-grade for essential oils. They are the purest grade EOs on the market. They are the essence, the blood, the life force, the immune system of the tree, plant, shrub, bush, flower, fruit, seed, etc.
Per Royal Raymond Rife's research back in the 1920's, just as our bodies have an electrical frequency, so do therapeutic-grade EOs. Processed/canned foods have a frequency of 0 MHz. Fresh produce has a frequency of 0-15MHz. Dried herbs have a frequency of 12-22 MHz. Fresh herbs have a frequency of 20-27 MHz. Did you know that therapeutic grade essential oils have the highest level of frequencies of all other substances in the world: 52-320 MHz! Just as you can take most herbs internally (e.g. via capsule, as a supplement, etc.), so can you with therapeutic-grade EOs! Another way to look at it in the herbal sense is they are the most concentrated form of the herb. In fact, they are 100-10,000 times stronger than the herbs they came from!
Such EOs are being used in hospitals, alternative medicine offices such as naturopathic doctors (N.D.s), doctor of osteopathy (D.O.s) and chiropractors as well as health & wellness centers, spas, massage therapy, psycho-therapists, hypnotists and raindrop therapist's offices. Yoga and meditation can also be incredibly enhanced through the use of these healing oils.
Many households are learning how to replace many of their ""over-the-counters"" as well as prescription medications with therapeutic grade EOs. Children are learning to come to mommy or daddy for their lavender or peppermint oil when they need to be wound down or have a tummy ache! In fact, many pet lovers as well as veterinarian offices are working with the oils as well, with incredible success! Note: you only want to use true therapeutic-grade essential oils on your pets for safety pursposes.
Did you know that such oils are the only oils allowed to be used in Raindrop Technique, a revolutionary way to bring balance and harmony to the body...physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is an emerging therapy in many massage therapist's offices, spas, alternative medicine clinics, etc. Raindrop Technique was created more than a decade ago. The molecules of therapeutic-grade EOs are so small they are the only substance on the planet which may actually cross the blood-brain barrier. You do not have to be a certified Raindrop Therapist to learn the technique or to give it to family and friends. You can also learn Raindrop to help boost your family and friend's immunity, such as during our cold winter months, by giving them Raindrop Technique.
An additional note, oils for healing, cleansing and masach (hebrew word for anoint, which means to smear, spread or massage) are mentioned more than 250 times in the bible. There is an answer for everything through nature. Essential oils have been used for healing/medicinal purposes since the beginning of time.
Thank you for spending the time to get to know a little bit about Therapeutic-Grade Essential Oils and their incredible benefits!
We are looking forward to ""Meetup"" with all of you!
Wellness, Purpose, Abundance & Vitality,  Laura Karowsky, Tina Jones and our entire Young Living Company of Angels family!

Making mistakes and not dancing perfectly on the beat is okay.   Being a beginner is okay.  We are not snobs.  We want to make going to dance clubs an enjoyable, friendly, social, and personal experience -- not a dance off or a showcase for one's greatness or an exercise in competitive social gamesmanship.
Our purpose is socialize, make friends, improve our dance skills,  create a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere, build community, and have fun!
We only have 4 requirements.
1. You MUST RSVP whether you will attend the event or not.
2. ""Flakers"" and No-Shows will be banned.
3. Follow and read the event details. Simple
4. You will make an attempt to attend within 3-4 events or you will be removed from the group. "

Adapt Foundation,0,"The Adapt Foundation is a charitable organization with the goal of assisting and providing support for the families and friends of drug addicts and alcoholics. There is a great deal of governmental and private assistance available for drug addicts and alcoholics but very few services and support agencies for the families and friends deeply and chronically affected by that same drug addiction and alcoholism. You may not be the alcoholic or addict but your life may be in a shambles as the result of that alcoholism or addiction in someone you love, a family member or a friend. The Adapt Foundation wants to help you just as the addict and alcoholic get help from so many resources throughout the community.
We who live with or near alcoholics and drug addicts suffer collateral damage from our loved ones addiction and behavior. At first we are confused by our loved one's behavior. We cannot understand the hows and whys of their destructive actions. We try to improve their situation and ours by assuming their life responsibilities. Eventually, we find that we can't do enough, and the life we live is no longer our own. We are trapped by our loved one's addiction.
There is hope. By understanding how addiction has changed our loved one, and by understanding how we have adapted to those changes, we can begin the journey back to ourselves.
The Adapt Foundation has weekly workshops open to the public where you will find the open arms of people just like you who are going through exactly what you are going through. We can help by providing you with a place to express yourself, examine your circumstances, consider alternatives, get helpful and educational information that is invaluable to a better future for you. Our attendees find our group workshops to be very interesting, supportive and satisfying. Come visit us some Monday or Thursday and see just what a comfort the group can be for you. You are certainly welcome to join us!"

Sonoma County Wanderers,0,"Welcome to The Wanderers!  You have just discovered Sonoma County's most active hiking group!  We love to hike...during the week, the afternoon, the weekend and even by the light of the full moon!  If you love to hike, you have just found your new home!  
We are about the journey as well as the destination.  We are striving to meet the hikers that fall into the middle zone...people that.enjoy moderate mileage with moderate altitude gain with a challenge thrown in occasionally at a moderate pace!    We are a group that wants to explore and constantly include new hikes while doing our favorites on a regular basis.    A group that is out there during the week as well as the weekend.
Our outings will normally be in the 5-12 mile range.  We are looking for people that are looking to improve their fitness level or are maintaining their current level.  If you are a moderate hiker that is hiking frequently you will find our hikes quite enjoyable.  If you are a new hiker or have recently just got back to hiking then our pace might be challenging for you at first until you fully get back into wandering on the trails.  We do average a speed of 2.5-3.0 mph and we keep going.  We wait at trail junctions and those of you in the front will have to wait and those of you in the rear will find that the group starts off when you are safely within sight.  Oh and YES, there will be altitude gain included in almost every hike.  You will need to be comfortable and happy with walking uphill.  You also will need to be steady on your feet for the down hills.  Once again, we stop briefly to keep the group together from time to time but we do keep going with the exception of our lunch/snack break.   A word of caution-if you haven't been hiking regularly you will need to give yourself some time and consistent participation to be comfortable with the group's pace.  Most people that start with us think our pace of 2.5-3.0 is fast until they have completed 4-5 hikes.   Don't get discouraged after one hike.  A common comment I get from new hikers is that they didn't have time to enjoy the scenery.  Trust me....as you continue with the group, you will find yourself being very comfortable with the pace and will fully enjoy the scenery.   
We are about hiking.  If you are into plant, mushroom, scat or bad mood studies then this group is not for you.  Although we love pictures and encourage photographs, if you are having a hard time staying with the group, you will need to let others take the photos until you find yourself able to keep up.
I'm not a professional hiker or guide and I don't have specialized training in first aid so I need to hold everyone completely responsible for their own safety and well-being. But, what I do have is a love of the outdoors and a desire to be there..whenever possible. I also have knowledge of many local hikes and am ALWAYS exploring new ones!  Come join me and we will simply enjoy this gorgeous area that we live in, find new adventures, laugh, talk and probably learn something new every hike while making new friends.
Happy Trails!"

Extraordinary Living Santa Cruz,0,"Extraordinary Living Santa Cruz is about connecting with our
inner wisdom even in our ordinary days. When we do the ordinary
becomes extraordinary. This group is for people who would like
energy and vitality to be their new ordinary day. It is for people
who would like to find themselves smiling and experiencing joy even
as they stand in line at the grocery store. When we are connected
with our own inner wisdom the ordinary becomes extraordinary
everyday. Things just seem to fall into place. We seem to know just
what we need to say and do. This meet up is for people who want to
develop this state of synchronicity as their typical average day.
Each and everyone of us already has all the personal wisdom and
resources we need to live the extraordinary life we want. With all
the the business of ordinary living those resources get pushed
aside and forgotten. When it comes right down to it the only thing
between us and the extraordinary life we could be leading is our
choices. We make choices all day everyday. Every choice, both big
and small is moving us toward or away from the extraordinary life
we want. Our present situation is the result of earlier choices.
This group is for people who -who know the choices of today create
their tomorrow -who want to create the habit of choosing
consciously -who are ready to get into action to raise the bar in
their lives"

Tom & I remember the challenges we had in learning to dance tango, a dance like none other, and we bring a special approach to teaching tango---I like to call it ""beginner's mind"" (in the mind of beginners there are many possibilities, in the minds of experts, few.)
Come join us all every Wednesday at 7:30 at La Pista, 766 Brannan St (between 6th & 7th), SF. And coming in February, 2012, we will offer Beginner's Mind Tango, every Friday night 7 to 8pm.
Join the ranks of those tango lovers (OK, addicts might fit) who plan our travel, work, and much of our lives around the next milonga (the venue where tango is danced). Many, but not all have been to Mecca (Buenos Aires). Come to a beginner lesson and get infected with this infectious ""at-ease.""

As of now, I plan on scheduling walks approximately once a week (early enough in the day to end before dark). This schedule could expand to additional days or short weekend hikes (probably on Sunday afternoons) if there is enough interest and participation.
Anyone who meets the above criteria is welcome to join. If you're interested, but can't make the weekly commitment, join anyway as our schedule is somewhat fluid and could expand to include different dates/times.
Only ""YES"" RSVPs are required! However, if you say you're coming please show up. Otherwise, please change your RSVP to ""NO"" so you don't get a ""No Show"" on your record. Out of respect for fellow walkers, people with three (3) no shows will be removed from the group.
Please see our other Pages (under the Pages Tab) for Rules and Agreements regarding participation in the South Bay Walking Group.

Tai Chi with Cheery Living,0,"Tai Chi is a ""meditation through movements"". Currently Huiling is teaching Tai Chi 18-form. Huiling has practiced Tai Chi 18-form over 20 years. Tai Chi 18-form can be practiced by anyone, anywhere, anytime, in any length (5-10 minutes, or longer). It's especially great for people who tend to sit for a long time at a desk. As a financial analyst worked in the banking industry over 14 years with long time sitting, Huiling really benefited from and truly believe in this natural, simple and rejuvenating exercise. The benefits from Tai Chi are: 1. Reduce capo tunnel symptom, alleviate neck and back sore from long sitting in front of a computer. 2. Enhance immune system, less allergic to pollen, less cold and flu, more stamina and energy 3. Increase flexibility. It's safe and no impact on joints. 4. Reduce stress, happier and more balanced view of life.  As an example, with Huiling's Tai Chi lesson help, Mary, one of Huiling's students was able to stop her many years of smoking. Huiling is offering lessons to individuals/corporate employees to learn this wonderful tool to improve their wellness and increase work productivity. Meeting Time and Location: Thus 11:10am-11:55am at St. Mary Square in San Francisco or by appointment For more Tai Chi 18-form background info, please visit  This is the same Tai Chi that Huiling is teaching. 1.

Santa Cruz Women Hiking,0,"Dear fellow hikers or potential hikers,
I love hiking in the fresh air of mountain and sea, and want to join with other women in exploring hiking trails in Santa Cruz and neighboring counties. My goal is to get good exercise, enjoy good company, and experience the serenity and inspiration of the great outdoors.
Most of the hikes I will organize will be in the 3- to 7- mile range with a gain of 200 to 2000 feet.  There are other organizers, however, who may do longer and/or more difficult hikes. If you're not ready to do the longer steeper hikes, try the easier ones! You are also welcome to come and do a portion of a hike, then return on your own. That's how I got started!
This group is for women of any age, who love hiking in beautiful natural spaces, or who would like to give it a try! It's also a relaxed and easy way to make new friends :)
If you have any questions about the group or the hikes, feel free to send me an email.
Best,
Kitty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I will do my best to describe the level of difficulty of each hike, so you can decide if the hike is right for you. I'll use the descriptions below to indicate how much uphill there is. In addition to the uphill, please take into consideration how long the hike is. A hike may be described as moderately easy, but if it's 6 or 7 miles long, that distance may be too much for you at this time.
Moderately easy = Up and down, but total elevation gain of less than 400 feet. 
Moderate = Total gain 400 to 800 feet. Lots of up and down. Can be steep stretches, but no really long steep uphill stretches. 
Moderately difficult = Total gain greater than 800 feet. May be some really steep sections and/or very long stretches of uphill. "

The practice of qigong includes various different postures, movements, breath and energy awareness, self-massage, and meditation. One could say, qigong in its highest expression, is for mind, energy, and form, to become more fully aligned and integrated with the wholeness of Spirit. 
Taijiquan is a form of martial qigong, which can be practiced solely for it's health and meditative benefits, and/or as an internal martial art. When practiced with consistency, these exercises help to relax and strengthen the body, the internal organs, and the immune system, improve balance and agility, build up the protective qi (energy) field, and bring quietude to the mind.  This ultimately helps promote longevity and an increased quality of living, as well as a clearer attunement of vital essence, energy, and Spirit (Jing, Qi, Shen). No taiji, qigong, or meditation experience is necessary, all are welcome attend.

Sheng Zhen Santa Cruz,0,"Sheng Zhen Gong is a series of natural movements and meditations that help unlock the full range of motion and grace inherent in the human body. This practice is a gift from heaven.  The words ""sheng zhen"" mean ""great purity"" and point to the original love that created qi and subsequently the rest of the universe.
More than just qigoing, when you practice Sheng Zhen you learn how to relax the body and go through each movement with the heart leading, enjoying the movements as one would enjoy being on vacation.  First you enter the ""qi state"" and feel your energy body leading the movements.  Gradually you move into the ""Sheng Zhen state,"" a feeling of being merged with Nature, merged with the universe, and the quiet wisdom of the heart takes over.  
As the heart opens through the practice of Sheng Zhen Gong, the experience of unconditional love becomes tangible and accessible. ""Gong"" literaly means ""practice"" or, more accurately, the results of that practice.  The results of the practice of Sheng Zhen include a healthier body, a happier heart, and an elevated spirit.
Classes are open to people of all ages and ability levels. 
I started this group to share the gift of Sheng Zhen with Santa Cruz.  I am happy that the group has been growing regularly and that many people have attended over the past several years.  We are adding new classes and workshops regularly and look forward to deepening this practice in Santa Cruz!"

Empowered Women Creating a Healthy Lifestyle,0,"Hello and welcome,
This is a supportive group for women interested in learning (and sharing) ways to create a loving and healthier lifestyle. My philosophy is that health is more than just what we put in our mouth. To stay 'healthy', we shall also consider our relationship with others, how we feel about ourselves, our career, of course nutrition and learning how to switch unhealthy habits into attainable and lasting practices.
Have you ever wanted to change something but got stuck or did it for a little bit then fell off the wagon? - raise your hand. Yup, quite a few of us, myself included. It is a constant effort to keep up with the changes, but here is the thing, the 'secret' to make them long lasting: is to make them fun and prioritizing yourself. Of course you might be asking, but I can't do it alone, sure you can! but to start we can find accountability in each other. (Trust me, I need some of that myself)
We might discuss topics (and not limited to) about health and wellness, healthy lifestyle, healthy eating, weight loss, women empowerment, acceptance, mindset, self-love, self-care, finding your 'why' and clarity, or do you need accountability? Depending how much interest there is, and to make it easier for people to participate, I might incorporate live-streaming (via FB, YouTube or zoom calls) which will be announced in advance.
My hope is that this group can provide the support and guidance in a loving environment with practical steps to create the life we want. It is a process and we are not alone.

"WALK IT OFF! Citrus Heights, Carmichael, Fair Oaks",0,"WELCOME! WE ARE THE Citrus Heights SPRINGIN' CHICKENS! AND WE'RE FAST WALKIN', TALKIN' & CLUCKING OFF THE POUNDS! 
Why join a gym for a treadmill when we have plenty of walking areas right here?  A classic eight-year study of 13,000 people conducted at the Institute for Aerobics Research under the direction of Dr. Steven Blair found that those who walked the equivalent of 30 minutes a day had a significantly lower risk of premature death than those who rarely exercised. So let's Walk It Off! 
Intro - Walk It Off is for women who want to start FAST walking regularly (3-5 Nights A Week) at a medium - fast pace (An 18-20 minute mile) for health and weight loss in Citrus Heights / Carmichael / Fair Oaks area. Meeting walk partners to help motivate each other and having regular & repeating meetups with safety in numbers is the main goal for this group. If you are a marathoner or run 10 miles per day please know that we are a beginning walking group with shorter fast walks. 
WHERE WE MEET - We will meet at a large nearby indoor Citrus Heights location in high temps or bad air days, or on rainy days, and outdoors at safe known neighborhoods or area parks.
WHEN - We meet in the PM HOURS, later afternoons AND many evenings indoors or earlier outside when the weather is more mild, depending on daylight hours. We walk approximately 2-3 miles which takes between 45 minutes to an hour. We can encourage each other, and there is safety in numbers! Mall walks have fast become a hit with this new group, as the mall has security, free parking, bathrooms, refreshments & shelter from the heat or rain all right there.. 
GOAL - The goal for this group is REGULAR FASTER PACED WALKING, shorter faster workouts more often, establishing a routine for cardio, health and fitness. If someone wants to host morning walks, they can do so, but this would mean a regular repeating commitment to HOST. Contact me if you are interested in this. 
SLOWER WALKERS - We welcome you, we have a few, and if you start coming out and doing this, you will see that your walk speed will generally increase. The evening Mall walks are perfect for everyone, we pass each other, and encourage and time our walks... HEY, no shopping! lol 
FUN STUFF - Occasional healthy dining out and Charity / Cause Walks will also be added to the calendar. If there's an event you'd like to add, just shoot me an email. 
Come on ladies, LET'S Walk It Off! =) "

Making Healthier Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts,0,"Do you have a passion for making ice cream, frozen custard, gelato, and/or sorbet? Perhaps you are interested in learning to make these frozen delectable treats for fun, family, coworkers, and friends. Are you already working ice cream magic at a professional or semi-professional level but have the desire to share recipes, mentor others, and/or provide a few tricks of the trade? 
Hi, I am Kevin and I love experimenting with and making healthier ice cream and frozen custard. Thanks to the encouragement of friends, coworkers, and family, I have recently started making them on a small, semi-pro level. It is easier than you may realize to make decent ice cream. In my Ben and Jerry's book on homemade ice cream and desserts, they mention how difficult it is to ""ruin"" a batch of ice cream. Chances are it will still be edible in the end! 
If you're on a budget, don't be discouraged. Let me emphasize that you don't need expensive, commercial equipment to make good ice cream and gelato. I've been successful using an old-fashioned ice cream maker (a model with a wooden bucket and electric motor), salt, and ice.
The ice cream varieties that I make are gluten-free, organic, non-GMO, and preservative-free. I plan to produce and test stylish alternative varieties including lactose-free and other lower glycemic varieties. So many folks want and need these alternatives. I take great pride in knowing that I am honoring my body and health while simultaneously honoring my sweet tooth! So little time and so much ice cream to make, 
You're cordially invited to share in the magic of learning, experimenting, creating, tasting, sharing, and celebrating ice cream and frozen desserts. Ever wondered what lavender blueberry vanilla custard would taste like? How about pistachio, mango, or grean tea ice cream?  Come join us for some ice cream alchemy, l welcome all skill levels. I look forward to meeting you! 
Sincerely, Kevin"

San Francisco Tapping Into Weight Loss Support Meetup,0,"This is a group for health conscious professional women who are tired of diets and the starvation/deprivation cycle to lose weight and want to regain health, vitality and confidence as well as take off a few pounds. Using alternative techniques like EFT-Emotional Freedom Techniques to let go of stored up stress and negative beliefs about weight that are mostly unconscious to people, a sense of peace and freedom from within is often found and eating behaviors change naturally- WITHOUT force or will power but almost without noticing. In this way not only does stubborn weight begin to come off but it stays off and with it layers and layers of stress and old limiting beliefs that tend to hold people back from reaching their true potential in many areas of life. The weight is just a symptom often, and even the focus on food and weight. The true issue at core is our dreams. What we do we really want? Are we holding ourselves back and why? The answers are always individual, and so are the miracles that come from tapping it out! Visit Eat LIke A Goddess now for a free 90 minute POWERFUL training to transform your life with food and your body."

East Bay Healthy Sensitive's,0,"If the word ""conscientious"" had a photograph in the dictionary, the photograph would probably be of you. Your friends come to you when they want a listening ear, because they know you WILL actually listen. YOU, my friend, are also a noticer. You notice the subtle changes in expressions of people around you. You notice the change in colors of the sky as the sun sets. You notice the sound of birds chirping in the tree outside in your backyard. You are, in other words, a Highly Sensitive Person ( There is just one teensy weensy little problem. We don't live in a world that is solely made up of subtlety. We live in a world of loud noises, bright colors, constant contact, and fast-paced changes.
So while you are easily entertained, you are also easily over-stimulated. If this sounds like you, you might ALSO have found yourself feeling like you only really have two options in this life. You can either choose to ""fake it""...pretending that you don't mind all the noise in your open office floor plan or the loud sirens in the city you live in or the constant whistling from your cell phone. Making that choice may make you uncomfortable, anxious, sleepless, and perhaps even prone to getting sick, but at least it allows you to fully engage in the world and share your gifts. OR
You can choose to retreat away from the world. You can move out into the mountains, write poetry, and become the newest Walt Whitman. You might be disconnected, but at least you aren't getting depleted day after day. You are anxiety free, even if you're also lonely.
THIS group is for those who want to develop something in-between. You want to fully engage in the world, share your gifts, help others. You aren't afraid to get messy. You just want to do it WHILE ALSO keeping your sanity, your physical health, and your sense of aliveness.

Fun with Food - Cooking and sharing meals,0,"****   Please Note   ****  Fun with Food is on hiatus until February or March of 2017, although there will probably be a holiday meal in December.   Next year I'm hoping to do Korean food and seasoning, Knife Skills for new members and those who couldn't attend in the past, pasta making if people want to, sausage making, and even some desserts.  I still want to do the Crab Boil and the Sushi event is always popular.  ****
Cooking together is a great way to learn and share knowledge and to enjoy food and good company. When I first moved here a few years ago, I took an expensive cooking course, hoping to meet people. Didn't really work out the way I had hoped.  While I learned some things, it was less than I learned from cooking with others  in the firehouse and I've never seen anyone from those classes again.
The basic idea is that we cook together, learn together and share great meals with the new friends we have made while toiling over the pots and pans.  Even if you can barely boil water, you are welcome at any of the events!  Since this is not a class and the host is not an expert, the fees are low, basically covering the cost of ingredients. 
If you do have skills or knowledge, please pitch in to help your fellow cooks succeed!  That's what it's all about.  I'm hoping to learn from you, too.
Despite these caveats, the food always turns out delicious and the company is great!  
Please feel free to contact me at 415-683-0533 or fiatgirl@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments.

Bhakti Kitchen: Practicing  Kitchen Yoga  !,0,"Take your yoga off the mat and into the kitchen. Eating matters. Living matters. Love matters more.
Practicing kitchen yoga is about more than just the asana; it's about thriving, in the most wonderfully counter cultural kind of way! We've seen our own lives soften, bloom and grow through practicing kitchen yoga in its many forms, and we want to share that joy with you, too - so come, love and be nourished in this beloved melding of philosophy and practice.
We use Patanjali's Eight Limbs of Yoga as a model for taking our yoga off the mat and into the kitchen, whether it's through cooking, baking, mindful eating, or just breathing well, and in so doing, learning to nourish our whole selves, one another, and the world. We believe that what we eat matters, that eating can indeed be a sacred act, and that yoga's an ideal path to that union with the divine.
Inspired by progressives like Michael Pollan, Gabriel Cousens and John Robbins, we teach how to eat Real Food: whole, fresh, organic, local when possible, and plant-based, the kind of food that nourishes the whole being, the community, the body, the spirit and the mind, creating balance, or sattva, in the circle of life.
Our work is grounded in a bhakti spirit of love and devotion, an emphasis on ahimsa (less harming) and compassion, and great gratitude to our many teachers. By eating to awaken, food can truly become that which brings us from darkness into light. 
Namaste."

South Bay Hiking With Kids Meetup,0,"This is a group for parents with younger kids who want to explore the great outdoors (with their kids) in the South Bay and Santa Cruz. Kids enjoy hiking more when they have similar aged friends to hike with. We combine hiking with good ol' fashion nature exploration and play along the way. We typically meet once a month for a shortish hike (2-3 miles) that includes stops along the way for snacks and exploration.
Our hikes are often single track, windy trails and sometimes with obstacles along the way. This is partly intentional, as it helps keep kids engaged in the hike.  Wide, paved trails tend to be less interesting for kids.  So, most of our hikes are not stroller friendly. If you have a younger child who may not be able to hike long distances a child carrier is recommended.

BDD Support Group Meetup,0,"This is a support group for those living with BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder). This group is for those who are preoccupied and obsessed about a certain body part/s which interferes and paralyzes your life. Our goal is to restore our ""self"" into a fully accepted, truly happy and content person, and help you find recovery from the debilitating and destructive nature of BDD and other body image challenges. We understand that attending a BDD support group will be a challenge due to the nature of the disorder, but trust that showing up challenges the disorder and provides an opportunity to accept and change our way of thinking and to heal. We understand because we have BDD too, and we need this just as much as you because it is part of the healing process.
The gathering is all about being with others who can relate to you and understand what you're going through. The meeting will be a safe and supportive environment in which to share your feelings, frustrations or whatever is on your mind related to living with BDD (or other body image issues). Sharing our stories and experiences will be a big part of us getting together and healing together, and eventually we will use other resources to help us heal and move forward, with formats like the 12-step approach, CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) practices, DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy), as well as some spiritual practices for those who are open to that. 
The meetings are free, but we do accept any free will donations to help cover any related costs of the group. We (Lon and myself) have more than 3 years of experience facilitating BDD meetings in Santa Cruz and Pleasanton. We've learned how to offer a meeting/gathering that is supportive, welcoming and compassionate. If you are interested, you can contact me, Tim, or Lon.

Solano County Body Positive Meetup,0,"""In a society that profits from self-doubt, liking yourself is a rebellious act.""
Firstly, this meetup is an MLM-FREE zone. None of our activities will be a hidden ploy to get you to buy oils, leggings, bags, jewelry, skin care, wraps, shakes, or weight-loss products. There are plenty of other groups here on Meetup and FB where people can find that if that is what they are looking for. Secondly, this is an open, safe environment where EVERYONE is seen and heard and valued regardless of weight, size, race, age, gender identity, or religion. This group is about building a supportive community within our community. We all have different stories and different backgrounds but the one thing we share is the belief that all bodies are beautiful and that everyone deserves to live life to the FULLEST.

Coming of Age Group for Women 60+,0,"Many of my friends, clients and acquaintances whose ages fall somewhere upward of 60 have shared their stories about how they do not feel their age. In fact, many have also expressed how they are feeling a vitality that they would like to cultivate and support in the face of cultural beliefs that those of us who are aging no longer have as much to offer.
As with all transitions, aging requires a continuous integration of the changes we are experiencing in our bodies, within our families, our communities and within our lives in general. In order to recognize our value and maintain connection with the dynamism of our souls, we must address the challenges we are facing in our lives. Grief and loss, physical challenges, devaluing cultural beliefs, changes in self-image, feeling without purpose and approaching death are some of the difficult issues that we face as aging women. Addressing these issues in a supportive environment can help us to re-engage with our deepest nature, discover our purpose, uncover our vitality and express the beauty and the wisdom of our unfolding souls. The Coming of Age group will provide a kind and loving environment in which to identify and dismantle the false and debilitating beliefs we carry about aging and allow for a spiritual unfoldment into the deeper truths of our lives."

In our culture, we are conditioned and programmed from birth with the script of the dominators of our culture. In this community we bond, grow, learn, unlearn, celebrate life. As a result of our conditioning from our society and our biological families, we act in ways and create a life that is counter to our own and our collective benefit. Through presentations, instruction, practices, video, creative expression, group exercises, healing practices, love, play, and emotion in safe created space, we will allow our spirit, our soul, our minds and our physical body to return to our essential state (to our essence) in connection to all (rather than in isolation). When we speak of personal growth we are creating a life that is
 - More and more Conscious
 -Living a life toward Meaning
 - being Considerate of the effects our thoughts, emotions, choices and actions have on ourselves, others, the world
 -Acknowledging the connection between ourselves and everything everyone and everything that appears not us

We want to understand the Earth's ecological systems -- from a non-technical perspective -- and the crises they are now undergoing with climate change.

We want to learn how we can live with global crises and support one another through the worst of times ahead since they are certain to impact all humanity! We want to connect with people who feel the same way -- that imminent ecological,  economic, and social collapse are important and require that we seek to understand the Earth and its sustainability requirements for life.
We normally expect to meet on the fourth Tuesday of every month from around 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm.  
We assume that Friends of Earth Awareness meeting at Humanist Hall will be humanist-friendly people who enjoy scientific thinking.  We show films and slides relating to climate change on our large movie screen and our smaller screen as well. And we have worthy books and articles to read on these issues too, of course.  We encourage Meetup participants to bring their own resources -- materials, ideas, and experiences -- to share. Films and books that participants would like to share and discuss should be readily understandable, not too technical. We have round table discussions to communicate what we are learning and experiencing.  We want to integrate what we learn about the Earth and humanity with how we live our lives in community with people and all the other life forms!
We are asking our Meetup participants to RSVP if possible -- and we are asking for a $5 donation per Meetup.

We'll cover topics like making your own toothpaste, deodorant, laundry powder, finding plastic free options, buying in bulk, food management tips, containers, urban gardening, kid's lunches and the list goes on! Come to mentor others or come as a newbie looking for support and friends. Zero waste newbies can start learning from the manual  available on Amazon. There is a lot to learn, but the rewards are enormous! Zero waste living is one of the most powerful steps you can take to save money, eat healthier and avoid toxic chemicals from entering your home. Zero waste living is important because all the stuff we throw away quite possibly has an even bigger environmental footprint than transportation or household energy, making up 30 percent of your total environmental footprint.  We are looking forward to meeting you!"
Shark Stewards Shout Out For Sharks Meetup,0,"Saving sharks for ocean health.Shark Stewards mission is to restore ocean health by saving sharks from overfishing and the shark fin trade, and protecting critical marine habitat through the establishment of marine protected areas and shark sanctuaries.
Sharks are symbols of ocean health. Sharks have swum the oceans for over 400 million years, helping to shape and maintain the health and balance of marine species and ocean ecosystems. Sharks have survived the five great extinction events, including the last which caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. For all this time, sharks were the top predators in the ocean. Until Now.
Today many species are threatened and could go extinct within our lifetime. Overfishing and shark finning is killing tens of millions of sharks per year at an alarmingly unsustainable rate. Driven largely by overfishing and the demand for the luxury shark fin soup, shark populations are plummeting world wide.Shark Stewards promotes sound stewardship for sharks, and all marine life.

Small things, big things, doing what we can to make our community healthier and doing away with food insecurities and teaching others by doing so.Not sure if this idea will fly, but if it does, maybe other cities and towns may establish similar efforts.I want the meetup to be about feeding ourselves, our families and our communities, one mouth or many as and when we can. Come, grow, create with like minded folk."

This means that all new buildings, averaged over a year, take no more energy from the power grid that they put back on the power grid from on-site power sources, presently anticipated as solar and wind. The key to achieving these recommendations is to build highly energy efficient buildings. Imagine how it will impact the United States and the world when California, the 8th largest economy in the world, achieves these performance standards!
