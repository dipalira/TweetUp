1,"Austrian Economics is not the economics of the country of Austria, and you don't need to go to Austria to learn about it - in fact Austrian Economics is right here in St. Paul! Austrian Economics is about the economics of real people making economic decisions in the real world. It is called Austrian because many of the first Austrian economists, like Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises, were from Austria. But Austrian Economics is now taught and practiced all over the world. If you are not familiar with Austrian Economics or Ludwig von Mises, you can get a quick overview here ( and here ( Please also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute ( which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School.
Our get-togethers are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace. Please join us!"
2,"This group is for citizens who are willing (or have) taken a second look into the attacks of September 11, 2001 and question the investigation procedure and conclusion. The group takes its lead from more than 2,300 professional architects and engineers who have called for an independent investigation. We meet to share this information from Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth to other citizens who are unaware of the third World Trade Center (#7) building to collapse that day. We encourage questions, open dialogue and support the standard practices for fire investigation using accepted procedures for scientific discovery."
3,"Are you are reeling from the recent election? Have you stopped listening to the media for fear that you will hear Trump’s voice? Or have you gone the other way and spent hours each day checking on what he has done, being outraged, and forwarding it on to others? Many people find they are now questioning their long-held beliefs about America, fellow citizens, and the future of our democracy. At this gathering Dr. Hunter will help you examine the psychological, emotional, and spiritual impact you have experienced from recent events, but more importantly, he will also help you identify what you can be done to recover from these negative effects, and to take meaningful action."

6,"Sick of driving to Minneapolis to get your fix of Austrian Economics? The Green Anchor - Austrian Economics Meetup has expanded to the Southern-burbs!
The Green Anchor has been meeting every week on the south side of Minneapolis, Minnesota since 2007 to discuss and learn... more about economic freedom. The title of the group, The Green Anchor, was the name of the restaurant in Vienna where Ludwig von Mises gathered with his friends and students to discuss economics well into the late evening.
If you are not familiar with Austrian Economics or Ludwig von Mises, you can get a quick overview here ( and here (
Also, check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute ( which continues to carry on scholarship in the tradition of the Austrian School. While we sometimes discuss local political and social issues that are of interest to our members, we generally choose a weekly topic relating to the free market. Our get-togethers are open to anyone interested in learning more about liberty, free markets, sound money and peace.
Please join us. To find out whether you are an Austrian, try this quiz! ("
11,"The over-arching theme of this discussion group is the ideas and manifestations of human freedom. We will discuss historical periods and people who have been significant in the progression and protection of individual liberty, as well as those individuals and regimes who have tyrannized over mankind. This will require us to develop an understanding of the various ideologies which have made both Freedom-Fighters and Tyrants tick; and the means by which they enlightened and inspired or deluded and intimidated critical segments of the populous and thus shifted the course of history in the direction of a free, voluntary social order or a hegemonic order of masters and slaves. Come get acquainted, enjoy a beer or coffee while listening to a short discourse on a predefined topic, then engage in creative argumentation, chaotic discussion, provocative insinuation, or just do what thou wilt and let that be the whole of the law."
14,"Celebrating the progressive ideas, activism and people of the western Twin Citiesl!"
18,It's a hard job but I have decided to do it. This group will be a safe and neutral meeting ground for all varieties of self-identified socialists. Ideally it should be a place where people can leave their labels and their (intellectual) guns at the door. Talk of the future not the past. Share what we agree on and be respectful about what we don't.
19,"PALLS is a group of progressively minded people working to improve our country through political action, education, or just good friendships. You decide what level of interest and commitment you will bring to the group. You can just socialize with people who share your values, or get more involved. Whether it be writing letters, calling Members of Congress, marching to the capitol, joining town halls (even empty chair events!) or just sharing a festive dinner with like minded friends, we create opportunities for progressives to meet, socialize and participate. PALLS organizes educational events and posts actions from other groups of interest to our members. We meet for coffee periodically and host Sunday brunches the third Sunday of each month. 
If you want to organize an event or cross list progressive activities, we will help you. We welcome and encourage new members to bring their ideas for events and activities to our group. Democracy takes work and it is involves all of us working together. Host a coffee chat. Organize an discussion group. Invite activists to tell us about their work. Plan a happy hour or an informal lunch or dinner. If you lean even a little bit toward the left, you will find friends here. "
20,"Minnesotans who are tired of living in the Nanny State get together once a week and drive over to Hudson to purchase beer, wine, liquor and sometimes gas. We'll save our receipts and tally them at the end of the year to demonstrate to the cowards in the legislature what the state lost because of their support for special interest groups."

We are residents of the Greater St. Louis Area (and other areas throughout the world) concerned about the many disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks and interested in finding out more about those events. We share the St. Louis Fusion Center's dedication to "". . . the collection, analysis and dissemination of information used to detect, defend against, or respond to acts of terrorism."" We have many disagreements, but we agree that 9/11 is worth inquiring into. We are inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Generally, we believe that when an object moves under the influence of gravity, the object goes down, not upwards and outwards in an arc, as objects did when the Towers ""fell.""
James Ridgeway says:
"". . . not one person in the White House—or in the cabinet, or the Pentagon, or anywhere in the Bush administration—was fired because of failure to perform on 9/11. Not one person resigned. With the exception of Richard Clarke, not one person apologized to the victims' families. Nearly twenty-eight hundred people died, and not one of the people responsible for protecting them was held accountable."" (The Five Unanswered Questions about 9/11, p. 88.)
And, several were handsomely rewarded.
  
Regarding the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was critical of Vladimir Putin, Reporters Without Borders states:  
""Novaya Gazeta editor Dmitry Muratov said there was still a 'political taboo' about the real mastermind’s identity. 'Six years have gone by – it is time to ask difficult questions,' he said.""
Fifteen years have gone by since September 11, 2001. Here in the United States, we too say: ""It is time to ask difficult questions.""
ATTEMPTS TO DISCOURAGE INQUIRY
(If you have not read Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, it is available here:   .)
We are aware that the bulk of the mass media are owned by at most six international conglomerates, and that they are united in their efforts to portray any inquiry into the events of 9/11 as somehow harmful or hurtful to the families of the victims of that catastrophe. But it was precisely a group of widowed mothers who first raised questions, and who pressured the government into conducting any investigation whatsoever. In the words of one of them, Patty Casazza, ""Likeminded, we all had questions. We all had questions, and we wanted answers.""  Their struggle to obtain information from the government is documented in the video 9/11: Press for Truth, at:  .
Seventy percent of their questions went unanswered by the 9/11 Commission, and are unanswered still.
Survivors have sued for the loss of their loved ones, and not one family member's case has been allowed to go to trial, where rules of evidence would permit questioning in public and under oath, and deponents can be compelled to answer. Widowed 9/11 family member Ellen Mariani  has challenged the official story in the U.S. court system for over a decade; repeated dismissals forced her to appeal unsuccessfully for a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. See:  .
We are guided by Donna Marsh O'Connor, who lost her pregnant daughter on 9/11.  Her feelings may be seen at: 
At:    she begs our members to use ""reasonable arguments,"" and ""just go out into the world and ask the fundamental questions of that day.""
At:   she begs the media to do their job.
While we do not expect media employees to disregard the requirements of their employers, we suggest that others are under no obligation to ignore obvious facts. Some of these obvious facts are on display in the short video ""The Official Account of the Twin Towers,"" which you are invited to see and share at:  .
Law Enforcement Officers have taken an oath to defend the Constitution, and so are under an obligation NOT to ignore obvious facts. If any are reading this, we suggest you also view:  .
Employees of the Department of Homeland Security are invited to view:  , and the related videos on that YouTube page.
Underlying the reluctance to look at such facts is the possibility that the government of the United States may have told its citizens a lie. That more general distrust of government is frequently called ""conspiracy theory""  by the mass media, and is sometimes characterized as a sort of mental illness. Regarding this matter, one may consider the statements of government psychiatrist Steve Pieczenik, M.D., Ph.D., at:  , and those of a panoply of psychologists and psychotherapists at 
""To test whether people conformed because the answer was uncertain, Asch devised a different experiment. Rather than putting people in a situation where the answer was unclear, he wanted to see what they would do when the answer was obvious. When people could easily tell the correct answer right away and thus would have no need to rely on others. The line-length task was a perfect choice. Even those with poor eyesight could tell the correct answer. They might have to squint a little, but it was right there in front of them. There was no need to rely on anyone else. Asch thought that when the answer was clear, conformity could be reduced drastically. To provide an even stronger test, Asch rigged the group's responses . . .
""Asch used the line task because he assumed it would reduce conformity. Real participants could see the right answer, so it shouldn't matter that others gave the wrong response. People should act independently and go with what they saw. Maybe a couple participants would waver once in a while, but for the most part people should give the right answer.
""They didn't.
""Not even close.
""Conformity was rampant. Around 75 percent of participants conformed to the group at least once. And while most people didn't conform on every trial, on average, people conformed a third of the time. 
""Even though people's own eyes told them the correct answer, they went along with the group. Even when they could clearly tell that the group was incorrect."" 
The video 9/11: A Conspiracy Theory, made by the independent journalist James Corbett, expresses another response to such characterization, and is available at: 
There is a Fifties-vintage song by ""Osama & the Bin Ladens"" (which in my opinion is excellent) entitled, It's All A Lie (Still You Believe) at:    .
At the website We meet occasionally at various locations.
The group has assumed the form standard for most political activism groups: main body of members, and a smaller, self-constituted body, often called a ""steering group"" or ""steering committee.""    It should be noted that although Meetup automatically assumes that all and only the people who RSVP YES show up, and not anyone else, this is frequently not the case, so the attendance figures which Meetup automatically posts are frequently not accurate, and comments on and reviews of the meetings are frequently neglected---by everyone involved. This is not advocated, but it is a fact. Don't assume a meeting was small or that nothing happened just because Meetup's tally and comments seem to indicate that. We're often more interested in doing than in telling what we've done, and we just have too many events to be much concerned about rating them.   In addition to talking in person, we have recently opened a 9/11 map on DebateGraph, in which we invite you (i.e., everyone) to participate.

76,"Do you believe that people may believe as they wish, but that they should not impose their religious beliefs on others and that the government's role is to protect the rights of all to believe as they wish while remaining religiously neutral?

We typically switch to getting together once a month in the summertime and in December.
Otherwise we meet twice a month, on first and third Monday evenings.
We are a friendly, informal organization, dedicated to reading, studying, & discussing Ayn Rand's ideas, books by other Objectivist writers, and current events or other issues from the perspective of Rand's philosophy, Objectivism."
81,"This Meetup is a ""safehouse"" designed specifically for those who seek to finally obtain the freedom promised by Dr. Martin Luther King, overcoming those last few remaining chains of slavery: racism, dependency, and the self-defeating and erroneous belief that their progress in some way depends upon the beneficence of White people. The leader of the Meetup is Mason Weaver, a former Black militant and radio call-in show host, and the author of It's OK to Leave the Plantation, Tribalism, and other books. Today, he is an activist, a powerful public speaker, a businessman, and an entrepreneur. He appears regularly on national TV, cable, and news programs."
82,"Bigger models have stopped calling themselves Plus-Size.  They now use the term Curve Model.  I like that.   Hence, Curve Feminist was born.
Are you done with diets and ready to accept your body as the flawless vessel it is? Are you finished apologizing for your size? Do you consider being happy with a fat body to be a political act? Is feminism (in any way you define it) a principal tenet of how you live your life?
Whether you think of yourself as curvy, Rubenesque, large, or fat, you're welcome to join this Meetup. We'll get together for drinks, discuss books, and enjoy the company of our fellow feminists-of-size. LGBTQI+ friendly. (Yes, trans-women and gender-non conforming feminists are welcome!) If the group grows and becomes active, we may expand into activism. However, this Meetup is first and foremost about creating community for fat feminists.
This is a safe space for fat women and gender-non conforming people. No diet talk or body shaming are allowed. Events will only be made visible to approved members. Persons who identify as male will not be granted membership."
86,"This is a philosophy workshop that focuses mainly on ethics and political philosophy/theory. The plan is to meet at least once a month to discuss a predetermined topic. For each workshop, I will begin by presenting the issue and then guide discussion. I usually have a handout for everyone as well. 
This workshop is designed for newcomers, so don't be shy!
Past topics include: the separation of church and state, paternalism, children's rights, libertarianism, and fairness.

Mission: Safeguard and nurture free speech in St. Louis through fellowship, education, and mentorship.
**All thoughts are welcome**
Three rules: 1) Control your emotions. 2) No initiation of violence. 3) No threat of violence.
Our long-term goal is to organize a Free Speech Rally in the St. Louis area."
94,"Here is your chance to move the water cooler at work out amongst the rest of the world. This multi-partisan group will talk about everything from politics to religion to race; the things that you aren't supposed to talk about in public. 
We are about the sharing of ideas and points of view. Points of view which will likely be different from views you currently hold. The goal is not to solve anything, but to leave the Meetup with a better understanding of how someone who hold beliefs completely opposite from you can come to their conclusions. This requires disagreement, but respect for other people and the acknowledgement that they are completely entitled to the views they hold. 
So bring your brain and your passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home. It is encouraged that we all leave as friends, but required that we don't leave as enemies. For this group to succeed, it is important that we have a diverse group of people from conservatives to liberals; from believers to non believers, etc. We need different nationalities, ethnicities and religions that come from all walks of life.
Caution: If you are a hothead, this is not the group for you. You won't enjoy the Meetup and neither will we. Besides, there are plenty of what I call ""Lovefest groups"" out there that are willing support your already held beliefs. This is a ""Learnfest!"" So come test your views on politics, heaven and hell, the best positions for making love, affirmative action, etc...what you learn should and could be fun!"
95,"The purpose of this meetup is to campaign for our liberties, which isn't limited to just government action, but taking personal responsibility to educate ourselves and fellow citizens on the US Constitution and our personal responsibilities towards our families and fellow citizens.
It is important to reach as many people as possible."
97,"Pachyderms believe that more good citizens need to participate in politics. We offer a meaningful movement of political clubs as a practical means by which broad citizen participation can be achieved. We are also a bit of a social club in which you can discuss the topics of the day with others. We are a Republican club,but there are different views within our club. This club has about 40 active members only a few us participate in the meet up page."
99,"This is for the ENTIRE state of Missouri:
We are looking to create a forum for a state-wide discussion of legislative issues facing Landlords. Recently, Independence Missouri passed a very intrusive, unconstitutional ordinance requiring bi-annual rental property inspection. This was passed with over 200 landlords in the meeting voicing opposition. They clearly didn't want our input. This ordinance seems to be on a roll and will appear in a community near you soon.
Comparing Missouri law to Kansas law, it is evident that much needs to be improved in the landlord tenant area. But, we need your help. Even if it is only your voice and your occasional attention. YOUR PARTICIPATION MATTERS."
103,"This Group will be reactivated in early 2013 when Michael Stevens returns from St. Louis to retake the reins, and I shall (very happily) relinquish my placeholder role.
In the meantime, feel free to join (or re-join) and acquaint yourself.

• More than 40% of eligible Kansas voters didn't vote in 2016.
• Kansas has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the United States. It is one of the few states to require both voter ID at polling places and proof of citizenship when registering to vote. 
• Since 2011, the “proof of citizenship” requirement has disenfranchised tens of thousands of potential voters. For example, in 2016, only 7,444 of the 22,000 voter registration applications submitted February 1 through February 21 were completed with proof of citizenship. 
• That means more than 66% of applicants had their voter registrations immediately ""suspended,"" and suspended registrants were purged from the voter rolls within 90 days if documentation requirements are not met. Because suspended voters are purged on a rolling basis, it is hard to give an exact number, but at least 37,000 were disenfranchised at one point in 2015.  
• This disproportionately impacts young voters, ages 18 through 29. Though they represent only 14.9% of the electorate, they make up more than 58% of suspended applicants registered through the Motor Vehicle Department.

170," The Purpose of this group, Is to Issue A Call to Action to those of you who value your Rights and Freedoms, A Call for us to work together to protect and defend the Constitution which has been under assault  and ignored by the United States Supreme Court since 2000 and by not just the U.S. Congress but the State Legislatures since 2007. Enough is Enough.
The goal of the group is to RESTORE both our Constitutional & Civil Rights that have  been taken away and to Protect and Defend the Rights we still have. The upcoming election is a battle for  the heart and soul of our country and it is not hyperbole to say that the future of this country is  truly a matter of life and death for the American people. & Honestly, too many men and  women have given their health and lives to keep us safe and secure. Too many Americans  have fought to protect and Uphold the Constitution, All the while defending our families, freedoms, & rights, as well as the many programs that have helped save millions of American lives.  These are programs that gave Americans a hand up in times of need, Programs that may of our current members of Congress benefitted from, but they Do Not want others to have the same chance, This MUST be Changed 
The Time has come for us to Speak the Truth, Even if your voice Shakes, Knees get weak, and You may be Shunned, The Truth has to be Spoken & Acknowledged, even though we may not like it. Too many Innocent people have  died and are being killed because of  the  rise of Racist, Bigoted, Hatred of not just the usual suspects but are being led by a National Political Party and a National Media company. And all this because we  voted for  a Bi-racial American Man, Instead of  a Warmonger & White man. It is clear by their Actions We have not come as far as we thought on Racism & Bigotry. We Finally have to Admit that the Hatred is still alive and well in our  country. So;
THIS IS YOUR CALL TO ACTION, It is Time To Restore the 4 Freedoms that this Country was  built on, In case You Do Not Know them they are as follows, as FDR expressed  them in his famous  speech:
(1) Freedom Of Speech
(2) Freedom Of & From Religion
(3) Freedom From Want
(4) Freedom From Fear
This is the United States Our Founding Fathers Established, A Nation that ""ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL"" IN BOTH THE EYES OF GOD & MAN! We Must NEVER Forget We Are All Americans, and Those who support & Promote Hatred Has NO Place in Our Country.
If You Feel the Same Way, I Sincerely Hope that You will Join Us as We Take Our Country Back, & Restore and Protect The Constitution, As we should have done all these years, Instead of Allowing the Extremist to dictate what we can and cannot do, what  they will acknowledge and  what  they ignore.

213,"THIS IS THE  ""ABOUT US""  PAGE
This ""intro"" is becoming quite an essay, but maybe that's OK.
I am very much looking for a first-rate thinker for a friend ,,,, someone who really ""gets it"".
Now, For those interested in, but UNFAMILIAR with, Objectivism:
If you like philosophy and are looking for a better system of thinking, you have stumbled onto a special place!
Objectivism is a point of view developed by Russian immigrant, novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, during the middle of the 1900's.  Since none of us can invent everything we know from scratch, we all need a high quality framework of ideas to think from.  Whether Objectivism is the final philosophy one should use or not, it is that high quality framework of ideas needed to think from.  All other points of view have been found to be inferior.  Objectivism also made the first big ""splash"" in the world as the viable alternative to left and right wing political theory.
The basics of Objectivism are really quite simple, but it takes a lot of great thinking to ""get it"",  UN-LEARN all the garbage that has gotten into your head, and see how the ideas fit together and apply to everyday issues.  If you are dedicated to the whole truth of all matters, then this is for you.  Some things you may have heard about Objectivism, or what positions a good Objectivist thinker would take, may be inaccurate. For example; Objectivism emphasizes ""production"", in contrast to ""consumption"". Proper Objectivists live GOOD lives, but they are not ""materialistic"", nor are they ""greedy"" capitalists.  Certain self described Objectivists are poor examples of its expression and do disservice to it.  Some well known figures seem to be profiteering  from it (see note at bottom of page).  Certain young followers sense something is special, but might lack the experience, maturity or aptitude to fully understand or practice it well.  Many people who are attracted to Objectivism are never able to fully ""get it"", or apply it well.  Most people who don't really understand the system eventually just drop out.
I recently read an article that points out the importance of being able to ""think things all the way through"".  I thought that was a nice way to put that.
Consider giving the Objectivist outlook a try and do your own thinking. Contact the group and discuss, question, or challenge.  When learning to understand life it is important to recognize those who do have a better grasp than oneself and LEARN something from them.
The Objectivist way of thinking is for good people who want to lead good lives.
SOME WORDS FOR THOSE FAMILIAR WITH OBJECTIVISM:
I have been disappointed in the ""mainstream"" Objectivist organizations.  My attitude toward the Objectivist movement is well embodied in the following thought:  “any good idea will attract all manner of people, with all manner of abilities"".  I see Objectivist organizations as either too reluctant to take positions, or else taking too many wrong positions.  It seems there aren't enough Objectivists who really ""get it"".
If my thinking thus far interests you, then read on.
I'm not about endless discussions of Epistemology.  Scholars are groping to find out exactly how the human brain mechanically does what it does, and that is ok.  But fortunately, complete knowledge of HOW the brain accomplishes reason is not at all necessary, and more than a few ""objectivists"" use these discussions as a diversionary and delay tactic.  All theories on just how the brain does what it does are just that, THEORIES!  I will say, however, that I think the ""filing cabinet"" analogy of the brain is very good and may explain a lot.  What IS necessary for right thinking is true intellectual independence, intellectual curiosity, and intellectual honesty.
Here is an example of how I think regarding the ""dispute"" between some Objectivists and modern science.  For the most part, sincere theoretical scientists are doing their best to understand the universe, and the fact that classical and modern physics are different things has no bearing on philosophical conclusions in ethics or politics.  No scientific theory on the behavior sub-atomic particles, the ""big bang"", or the behavior of things around black holes could ever have any effect on proper ethical or political conclusions.  Man inhabits the world at HIS scale, and there is certainty at HIS scale!!
While I'm at it I'll assert that Objectivists attempts to prove the non-existence of a God are as silly as attempts of theists to prove that there is one.  As philosophers we are under the mandate to not attempt to prove a negative.  You cannot prove that there is no god.  I'm aware of Peikoff's agrument in OPAR.  It is flawed with logical fallacies.  All one can formally say about the matter is that existence exists, and leave it at that.  Serious speculation on matters prior to, or outside of existence is the problem ---- and it is perfectly OK to speculate about it ---- non-seriously !!
Our purpose here is to provide contact (intellectual or otherwise) for independent idea loving people.  The small group is currently communicating by regular Email at rodney203@aol.com
Although the name ""Independent Objectivist"" is technically a redundancy, I regret that it is a necessary one for the forseeable future in the Objectivist community.
I am ""Objectivist based"". Ayn Rand is credited as being the most generally honest, thorough and correct modern philosopher; her works putting so many ideas together in one neat package to be considered- akin to the “Theory of Relativity” in physics.  The ideas set forth by Rand and others is the most logically consistent and ""proven"" philosophy of which I am aware.  No other system has gone to such great lengths to ""prove"" its ideas.  I'm not overly concerned with which ideas were Rand's original insights- she put it all together in one place, with the interpretations that she made, and that's important.   Otherwise, it is not my intent  to adulterate / corrupt what is considered to be Objectivism. We are solid friends of the Objectivist way of thinking; however, since philosophy is a human observation, all peoples’ inductions and deductions are at least subject to sincere inquiry and evaluation.  Ideas can be ignored, misused or misapplied by anyone.  We are looking for the truth of matters.  What is needed most are people who can achieve a decent deduction of existing Objectivist theory to all aspects of daily life.
Here are a few additional examples of positions I hold:  That Objectivism is a theory and set of principles, and NOT a set of conclusions.  If one is under the impression that some particular conclusion is the ""correct"" Objectivist position, do not assume that I automatically agree with it, (and I may very well agree with it); though MANY conclusions in the Objectivist movement are quite obvious.  I believe that existing Objectivist NONFICTION materials on close relationships, love and sex is actually lacking in the logical rigor found in some other of its other topics - reading more like instructions for writing romance novels than something from a logical philosophy (note: I have now read Atlas Shrugged and I have no major complaints on the romantic accounts there.  I have also been reading some books lately from the ""men's rights/men's awareness"" movement, and it seems to me that Objectivist leaders have some explaining to do regarding their superficial and somewhat mystic coverage of relationships and sex.  I suspect that the lack of proper treatment of this topic is due to the fact that it would be extremely unpopular with certain followers.  Still, a great disservice is being done it seems.)
PLEASE communicate with me directly at rodney203@aol.com

Note:  Defining ""profiteering"" in this context would be an admittedly difficult and complex task.  I do not intend to use it here as a ""floating"" smear.  I merely appeal to those readers who, after considerable observation and thought, think they too see that such things do happen in the Objectivist community.  Profiteering, in this context, would have something to do with placing maintaining one's customer base above dedication to truth and reality, whether one realizes one is doing it, or not.  In other words, being the ""witch doctor"", that Objectivists so eagerly despise.  ""Witch Doctor"" means dealing in MIS-information!

299,"Mission: To advance the rebirth of openly accountable constitutional and republican institutions that rigorously protect our natural rights and liberties. We are committed to truth, justice, equality, security, and peaceful solidarity among all peoples of the Earth. We must be the change we wish to see in the world.
We view the events of 9/11 as a massive lever that members of the power elite used to launch an unwinnable ""global war on terror,"" and rapidly reduce or eliminate our constitutional rights and protections.  We are working in many ways with other groups toward a proper investigation of those events that will finally lead to justice for those who have paid so dearly.
We are also working to reverse some of the damage already done and prevent new crimes from happening. For example:
•  We want to stop the senseless wars and killing innocents for empire, power, and greed. 
•  We want to bring our troops home and close the 800 military bases we have all over the world in other people's countries.
•  We want to withdraw all the obscene trillions of dollars allocated for unconstitutional wars and spend it, instead, on making America whole and strong again. 
•  We want to bring an end to the rhetoric of hate, fear and anger toward one another -- the negative energy that spawns violent acts of rage by whatever weapons are handy.
•  We want to stop the government's intrusion into the decisions of individual lives, from child rearing, to the substances put in the water we drink, to the medicines and treatments we choose, to the education we provide our children.  
• We want to end the Federal Reserve and return to debt-free money controlled by the US Treasury. We want our economy back in the hands of Americans, not international bankers.
• We want to awaken millions more to the corruption and divisiveness NOW, while we still have the freedom to do so. 
• And we want to ultimately stop the corruption, prosecute the real criminals, and restore our America to its founding principles. 
We are not a talk therapy group, though we believe that taking meaningful action can be therapeutic for those of us whose souls have been damaged by the darkness around us. We are looking for and implementing real solutions that can have a significant impact. If you are eager to make a difference, and if you have ideas or skills you think can help, we need your energy and your creativity.

300,"The short story is that we're just a bunch of Democrats who meet for Happy Hour. 
But being a Democrat isn't the point. And I don't mean to suggest that you have to identify as a Democrat to be here. No, that's not it at all -- but that's probably the word most people are familiar with. We're not looking for labels and we have no agenda. We're just a bunch of forward thinking liberals (i.e., liberally thinking people) who appreciate each others' company. And the second Tuesday of every month is when we make an extra special effort to hang out with our favorite bartender. (Patricia is awesome.) 
Sometimes we talk politics and sometimes we don't. We're very welcoming, but if you classify yourself as a red, red Republican, then this group isn't for you. And if you're just curious, come on down! 
Another thing to note: even though we have no agenda, we *are* welcoming to candidates during election season. We won't endorse anyone, but we're happy to have candidates come out to kiss hands and shake babies. After all, isn't it important for us to be engaged? (Hint: YES.)

305,"WE ARE much more than just A 9-12 GROUP FOR ALL TEXANS. If any unconstitutional act of government is illegitimate then the people have a duty to withdraw their consent to that act, as provided by the maxim of law providing that the lesser power is INCLUDED in the greater. This group will use DIRECT ACTIVISM and THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE to PETITION the State of Texas to REJECT AND RESCIND all UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWS and ACTS passed in the Texas and United States Legislatures. This Right of We the People is well described in the FIRST AMENDMENT which states in part, ""...the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.""
A constitution is analogous to a limited power of attorney. For the purpose of the relationship, the people are sovereign; and the government their agent. The constitution both grants power and LIMITS power granted.
As members of the sovereignty, to remain consistent with the principles of the declaration of independence, the American people have a duty not to dignify a statute passed that is repugnant to the constitution. In truth, if the agent (government) has transgressed the principal's (We the People) delegation of power, the principal has a duty to call the agent on it to avoid giving the appearance of consent. The American people have a duty not to consent to an unconstitutional act masquerading as law.
We seek to gather all Texans to stand together against DESPOTIC ACTS AND LAWS BY THE GOVERNMENT IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.
This is NOT a ""secessionist"" group per se, besides Texas already seceded from Mexico in 1836 just as America seceded from England in 1776. However, we reserve the right to pursue any and all peaceful, non-violent measures, including political action, nullification, negotiating a new arrangement, or even (as a last resort) full independence for Texas if that's what it takes to restore our freedom. Even if it comes to that, we would be happy to restore the REAL Texas and the REAL America and maintain that relationship.
We acknowledge that America and Texas were founded upon the principles described at the Common Law Institute at  and we intend to peacefully restore legitimate governments that adhere to those principles instead of violating them."

309,"We call ourselves “North Texans for 9/11 Truth” and/or “North Texans for Truth”.  We began in 2006.
Our MISSION is simple:  We endeavor to make a better world by educating ourselves and others.
Our ACTIVITIES – We do what we can do on a local level with the resources at hand.  Over the years we have accomplished hundreds of actions.  (Examples: Giving our more than 69,000 DVDs, literally tons of literature, putting on events & films at theatres and colleges, bringing in famous guest speakers, advertising “the truth”, flying a banner over The Byron Nelson & DFW area, participating in protests and sign waves, being featured in local and international news articles, etc.)  
Our TOPICS – Our topics of discussion and involvement include 9/11, deceptions, frauds, manipulations, false flag events, natural health, fluoride, alternative energy, the environment, gardening, permaculture, healthy food, weather manipulation, philosophy, politics, spiritual growth, personal enlightenment, music, art, education, money & finance & business, etc.
9/11/2001 – We generally focus on the topic of 9/11, especially “Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth”  
EVOLUTION –  An evolution in awareness occurs as a person discovers the deceptions.  Often a person continues to research, gain knowledge and become more enlightened.  At a certain stage in maturity, an individual recognizes that it is important to “do something” .
JOIN US – Please join us.  Take the journey.  It doesn’t matter what stage you are at…whether you are “just curious”, a beginner, or you already have done lots of research, or you have evolved into the higher echelon of wanting to actively participate in bettering conditions and opening people’s minds.
WE DON’T SPY – We don’t spy on you.  We don’t monitor nor try to manipulate you.  If you are concerned about the government monitoring your actions when you join…Well, the government already has a record of your every web search, phone calls, your finances, your associates, and much of your personal life including intimate details.
This is a fun, friendly group full of intelligent, talented, like-minded people whose motivation is TRUTH and COMPASSION.

317,"Principled, Consistent - The Libertarian way is a logically consistent approach to politics based on the moral principle of self-ownership. Each individual has the right to control his or her own body, action, speech, and property. Government's only role is to help individuals defend themselves from force and fraud.
Tolerant - The Libertarian Party is for all who don't want to push other people around and don't want to be pushed around themselves. Live and let live is the Libertarian way.
 
You don't have to live in Nacogdoches County or be a LP member to join this group. Free thinking individuals of all stripes are welcome. The purpose of this group is to advocate principles of self ownership and to seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others."

Ideally, we would like to have a substantive, in-depth discussion and analysis of a political issue or topic during each meeting.  We would also like to have members representing as many diverse viewpoints and political perspectives as possible weigh in on each issue.
The emphasis for each issue discussion will be as follows:
1. Discussion of the issue itself (agreeing on the problem to be solved and the desired outcomes).
2. Presentation of various proposed solutions to the problem (preferably from a variety of political perspectives).
3. Comparing and contrasting the proposed solutions to the problem in terms of how well they satisfy the desired outcomes.
Again, we welcome ALL political perspectives (even those that are not so popular).  The most interesting meetings are those that compare and contrast many perspectives on the issues.  However, if you'd rather not voice your opinion on the issues, feel free to come and listen."

It is OK if you don't yet have your mind made up or if you have questions."
407,"In our society, we are inundated with information: text messages, “tweets”, commercials, sound bites, etc. Sadly, with all of this information, there is very little knowledge. Today, if you were to stop and ask someone questions like:

What form of government do we have?
Can you explain the difference between the national debt and the deficit?
In our current monetary system, do you think it is better to have our current fiat system or was the classical gold standard better?
What is the role of the U.S. Constitution? The State Constitutions?
Does our trade deficit hurt us in the global market?
Can you explain the political relationship between the Federal Government and the State Governments?

You will probably be met with blank stares, a shrug of the shoulders, or an “I don’t know”. Questions like these can sound hard, scary or maybe even boring but, knowing the answers to things like this are critical to understand the things that are affecting your life. They:

Affect the prices you pay in the supermarket, for a car and most everything else you buy
Can determine how you are allowed to raise your children
Can affect the price of your utilities or who you are allowed to purchase from
And on and on…

They are also critical in being able to make an informed opinion on the candidates we select to represent us in office and the legislation that is passed. In our society, politics has been boiled down to a sports like mentality. People pick either a Democrat or a Republican and then cheer their “team” in the elections. This, sadly, is the problem with the direction of our nation. People no longer seek knowledge or have political discussions beyond typical partisan talking points.
That is why “Wake Up And Smell The Freedom” was started. To give people an environment to openly ask questions and discuss without having to feel silly, ashamed, or embarrassed. We try to make the environment as friendly and laid back as possible and our discussions are topic driven not partisan. Many people are surprised that the answers too many of the questions above and many other questions are really not that difficult if you have just some basic understandings. So, come join us and make some great friends along the way as we journey down the path of knowledge."
